, bless my finances so I'll be able to do X , Y , Z for my son or wh	able	A	A	tn
r four places for people to be able to live affordably . And not ch	able	A	A	tn
people . N- everybody should be able to live in a home , no one shou	able	A	A	tn
up here cause I ain't gonna be able to afford that . Two thousand d	able	A	A	tn
money from high school . I was able to stack that up , get ready to	able	A	A	tn
really wouldn't know until we able to fight for the cause and get	able	A	A	tn
hole time . But you'll never be able to know that until you open yo	able	A	A	tn
isten to the spaces . And being able to create something not from n	able	A	A	tn
e was great . Um . We used to be able to let our dog out , and she ju	able	A	A	tn
um , my mom was like , we may be able to get our old house back . I w	able	A	A	tn
it back honestly , but we were able to get that house , it was nice	able	A	A	tn
hen we do- I mean- When we are able to see each other , we- we embr	able	A	A	tn
we- when we do or when we are able to get together , we just like ,	able	A	A	tn
sses . So that's how I w- I was able to introduce , to have conversa	able	A	A	tn
een for a while . But they were able to keep it kind of quiet . And	able	A	A	tn
vel . Where both sides would be able to compromise to say , alright	able	A	A	tn
ill concern that we may not be able to move remove snow . I'm think	able	A	A	tn
- these restaurants that we're able to go to . Uh , except what- Do	able	A	A	tn
ow , my school allowed me to be able to again be that chameleon and	able	A	A	tn
be able to kind of just blend and fit	able	A	A	tn
r about it . I appreciate being able to go out locally . And have th	able	A	A	tn
ssing that I am still here and able to- to talk about it because a	able	A	A	tn
necessarily work for me , I was able to experience them . And I thin	able	A	A	tn
think I'm more focused and I'm able to prioritize , I'm able t- to	able	A	A	tn
it has in the past because I'm able to like I said , prioritize my	able	A	A	tn
assroom because you have to be able to be focused , you have to be	able	A	A	tn
as given to the person who was able to pay for it to bring it out .	able	A	A	tn
I'm saying , you supposed to be able to see a nigga coming from dow	able	A	A	tn
d better . Cause we'd have been able to really get into clubs , you	able	A	A	tn
laid off and- so they weren't able to keep up that lifestyle , so	able	A	A	tn
ed to be friends , we should be able to trust each other . And that	able	A	A	tn
make sure I was able to give her . And that was the	able	A	A	tn
over that fact , then we'll be able to conquer this whole thing an	able	A	A	tn
um , and- which allows me to be able to work more independently , yo	able	A	A	tn
a little scuffle . End up I was able to beat the boy . < laugh > And t	able	A	A	tn
out there , supposed to stay be able to stand his ground you know ?	able	A	A	tn
his arm , that hooks on . He was able to get the briefcase off the g	able	A	A	tn
s getting new ones . So , we was able to get their books . And now , w	able	A	A	tn
ing today and- and sell and be able to pay off your bill . And then	able	A	A	tn
ly impressed me was how he was able to um get the film from the gu	able	A	A	tn
was able to reach it , I stopped pushing	able	A	A	tn
l , and as he got larger he was able to reach it you know ? When he	able	A	A	tn
we had to do and , um , still be able to run a office at the same ti	able	A	A	tn
, people who grew up here were able to start on they own . And I th	able	A	A	tn
tle bit more , you would uh , be able to appreciate it more . Therefo	able	A	A	tn
t , c- w- At the time , you wont able to get into it no way . If you	able	A	A	tn
your mother wouldn't have been able to- to have that type of large	able	A	A	tn
is brother , then you should be able to play . I couldn't play at al	able	A	A	tn
I went when I was five , I was able to go to I was is the first gr	able	A	A	tn
nday through Friday . And I was able to actually , save money toward	able	A	A	tn
ound to make sure you gonna be able to receive instructions and , u	able	A	A	tn
in basic training , < ts > I was able to um , I was given a position	able	A	A	tn
nated me from having to- being able to go outside of the United St	able	A	A	tn
rk as it was , they wouldn't be able to see ' em . And I went back to	able	A	A	tn
les from Goldsboro . And he was able to- he was in the military . He	able	A	A	tn
regards to who I was gonna be able to , you know- who- who did I t	able	A	A	tn
is that , um , the reason I was able to work that hard is because o	able	A	A	tn
immune system , where I wasn't able to fight off a lot of- yeah . A	able	A	A	tn
know , them dying or not being able to be- you know , grow up and e	able	A	A	tn
t- cause you different . And be able to fight the vampires head up .	able	A	A	tn
om our earth , how would you be able to keep track of time ? It's im	able	A	A	tn
as a reality to me , so . And be able to come from that and to be wh	able	A	A	tn
know , in regards to just being able to you know , or I'm not gonna-	able	A	A	tn
tures . And you know , and being able to- it made me learn m- more a	able	A	A	tn
et used to something you'll be able to build up a tolerance for it	able	A	A	tn
given the fair treatment to be able to stay in their homes , especi	able	A	A	tn
now that we , you know , we were able to get , you know , we can get i	able	A	A	tn
so that you can , you know , be able to bring in somebody who's abl	able	A	A	tn
my LPN in ten months and being able to actually work in the field ,	able	A	A	tn
uh counselor said I should be able to uh do the work , so what and	able	A	A	tn
al thinking , you know , we were able to figure it out , even if you	able	A	A	tn
get a proper education and be able to , um , you know , be exposed t	able	A	A	tn
ection of the city ? Then we be able to travel everywhere we want t	able	A	A	tn

dence academically , what I was able to do and what type , you know ,	able	A	A	tn
know , have to- well when I was able to go by myself , a bunch of us	able	A	A	tn
f myself that , you know , I was able to , um , yeah . I y- I used to-	able	A	A	tn

g they're paying attention and able to absorb what the- this speci	able	A	A	tn
whether we were gonna still be able to graduate early . And so I en	able	A	A	tn
them , and they seem not to be able to get along . And so then they	able	A	A	tn
a year older , so you won't be able to be here . We got to send you	able	A	A	tn
you might- everybody might be able to only grow two plants cause	able	A	A	tn

m all under my wing , and me be able to touch them all how I want t	able	A	A	tn
that stuff . Cause I want to be able walk anywhere and ain't got to	able	A	A	tn

nal expression is- is normally abstract . It's normally , you know what	abstract	A	A	tn
s there . Like , they would make absurd complaints about us . Oh , there	absurd	A	A	tn
he was like very like verbally abusive like , he would be like , oh you	abusive	A	A	tn
ave to always use force . Or be abusive to the community to get law an	abusive	A	A	tn
g that he had- you know he was abusive he had beaten her and everythi	abusive	A	A	tn
better . So it was- w- It was a academic competition , so it's- a compet	academic	A	A	tn
> that was more of the- like a academic school . Um , so just depending	academic	A	A	tn
in like a better environment- academic environment when I went to < sc	academic	A	A	tn
ucation . I had a very rigorous academic experience at < school > and I a	academic	A	A	tn
d to go to < school > which is a academic high school . I kind of regret	academic	A	A	tn
learn from it . < school > , as an academic institution , has a very strong	academic	A	A	tn
It really was . Um , so for the academic experience , truly appreciate t	academic	A	A	tn
cause you went from having two academic teachers to having four . And h	academic	A	A	tn
ve had to take with her . So my academic advisor told me that you could	academic	A	A	tn
e don't have- there's a lot of academic bashing that , oh , you have to	academic	A	A	tn
she got a partial scholarship- academic scholarship for Penn State , Un	academic	A	A	tn
, they- uh , < school > put me on academic probation . And then the next s	academic	A	A	tn
o you have different levels of academic rigor . You know ? I don't know .	academic	A	A	tn
I did study ? Mm . Well , I had a academic course , so I had uh , Governmen	academic	A	A	tn
ng , but that's not you know , a academic course . That's a Business , but	academic	A	A	tn
thing was that I had been in a academic course Which really prepared m	academic	A	A	tn
school right now . I was in uh , academic course . Took uh- You want- You	academic	A	A	tn
that you didn't get , like , an academic job ? Like , literally that's I	academic	A	A	tn
and um it is a very very good academic school . It's um it's a school-	academic	A	A	tn
' m trying to , like , apply for academic jobs , cause , that's a major co	academic	A	A	tn
ically , like , you didn't get a academic job so they maybe think that I	academic	A	A	tn
ve now , I still go to the same academic conferences , that , uh , you kno	academic	A	A	tn
personality traits of an aca- academic , but I also care about social	academic	A	A	tn
gan to , um , gain my confidence academically , what I was able to do and wha	academically	R	POSTVB	tp
ry strong reputation as a very academically rigorous school that you can g	academically	R	NPAM	tp
er . And so although I did well academically , I had a- an- a guidance couns	academically	R	POSTVB	tp
od grades , still wanting to be academically successful , cause that's impor	academically	R	PREJJ	tp
sn't really fully prepared um , academically , and that was heartening . But	academically	R	POSTJJ	tp
to , you know , challenge myself academically . Um , a- a- and just trying to ,	academically	R	POSTVB	tp
ng these types of < ts > academ- academically , um , excelled children , right ?	academically	R	NPAM	tp
< ts > The education was there . Academically I fit the education . So this w	academically	R	PREVB	tp
left < school > because I was so academically excel in < school > , um , < school	academically	R	PREJJ	tp
> may or may not be , it is not academically as rigorous , a- I can say for	academically	R	PREJJ	tp
ine . So for me , it was kind of acceptable . But maybe for a person that l	acceptable	A	A	tn
daily struggle around , what's acceptable , how much you're willing to pu	acceptable	A	A	tn
e asthma . So I was always , um , acceptable of getting , you know- you know	acceptable	A	A	tn
e , I- I don't want it to be s- acceptable just to say how you feel , wher	acceptable	A	A	tn
wanna be in a place where it's acceptable to like , put your confederate	acceptable	A	A	tn
- that emph- That are socially acceptable or that the way that the schoo	acceptable	A	A	tn
Yes , let's move on . That's not acceptable . That's- see- that's what our	acceptable	A	A	tn
million niggas that might just accidentally click your mother fucking vide	accidentally	R	PREVB	tp
. Well the first one my father accidentally stepped on . The next one flew	accidentally	R	PREVB	tp
o come to me , I will handle it accordingly . But I just want respect . And	accordingly	R	POSTVB	tp
they were then uh , I would act accordingly . But I can honestly say I don '	accordingly	R	POSTVB	tp
hat is- that's not necessarily accurate . But it was just- Because if y	accurate	A	A	tn
e floor really quick . And it's accurate , and you- you know , it helps t	accurate	A	A	tn
your message is not- it's not accurate . While you may- while you may-	accurate	A	A	tn
I think for me why listening- active listening is so important beca	active	A	A	tn
e young parents today , is stay active . If you don't wanna be on the	active	A	A	tn
street just stay active , keep your kids active . Um , Th	active	A	A	tn
as difficult for parents to be active in the schools because they we	active	A	A	tn
teenager is that we were more active . We went bowling , we went skat	active	A	A	tn
ng coming down um , b- became a active member . I met a lot of positiv	active	A	A	tn
tepped up more . They were more active . They reached out more . There	active	A	A	tn
et , and I'm- now that I'm more active and fit I'm trying to get her	active	A	A	tn
ook Spanish . And I became more active in uh- uh- thespian . So um , I	active	A	A	tn
If you keep your kids active then you shouldn't have any pr	active	A	A	tn
y active in all her school activities .	active	A	A	tn
anna survive DC you have to be active . So . That's some good advice .	active	A	A	tn
ids do after school ? Keep them active . I try to keep ' em in sports .	active	A	A	tn
d though . You know , it kept me active . Kept my mind active . Um . And	active	A	A	tn
care center and um , she's very active and everything in um , church-w	active	A	A	tn
Uh-huh . Yeah . Yeah we was very active . Mm-hm . We would uh , plan you	active	A	A	tn
to high school a lot so I was active in the community . I'm a substi	active	A	A	tn
ute teacher also and so pretty active . You know , and- and- and in go	active	A	A	tn
ing was v- her mother was very active . Uh-huh . < name > . Uh-huh . Yeah .	active	A	A	tn
espect and we try to keep them active to keep them off the streets .	active	A	A	tn
zed by this time- We were very active in my daughter growing up , ver	active	A	A	tn
you know , so uh but she's very active in the uh church , you know , sh	active	A	A	tn
d- um , and , you know , I- I was active in the nineteenth ward communi	active	A	A	tn
< school > c- I've always been a active kid , dancing , um , cheerleading	active	A	A	tn
h she's- um , she's really , um , active in the community with differen	active	A	A	tn
ied- You know , I- um , I stayed active . Um , tried to get into some ac	active	A	A	tn
y < laugh > to me . Cause she was active . She wanted to go walk and I w	active	A	A	tn
moth- my mother was like very active in my life , like she did every	active	A	A	tn
serve but he just went back to active . Yeah . Um , and my mom is a ret	active	A	A	tn
No , two . She's uh- she's very active . Her name is < name > . < name > . Y	active	A	A	tn
ighty Mel I think was uh quite active at that time . And he used to u	active	A	A	tn
irst- like basically the first active billionaire athlete . You under	active	A	A	tn
gue . So i- i- it kept the kids active , you know . But this- k- the ki	active	A	A	tn
come from somewhere that's so active , and you come to somewhere tha	active	A	A	tn
to let that alone . But , I stay active . Mostly go shopping , gl- just	active	A	A	tn
nds . < ts > So and like , I don't actively seek out white friends but lik	actively	R	PREVB	tp
and nineteen sixty four , work actively in uh , politics as- Behind the	actively	R	POSTVB	tp
residents and like , I've been actively putting myself out there to co	actively	R	PREVB	tp
ee , I couldn't participate too actively , but uh , I did um , in nineteen	actively	R	POSTVB	tp
back to your dorm and do your actual work and then study , but um , I	actual	A	A	tn
l players . Like he going after actual football players , niggas that	actual	A	A	tn
know that hook , and now this a actual song . And getting played on ra	actual	A	A	tn
only issue there was like , the actual living situation that I went t	actual	A	A	tn
ow , in the right direction not actual kicks . But like , yeah , I think	actual	A	A	tn
could get . This was before the actual flood came . And um , she got my	actual	A	A	tn
' s like , don't forget about us actual people , that actually live in	actual	A	A	tn
t , whoever that is . Um , beyond actual just having metaphors and word	actual	A	A	tn
d who he wanted to come to his actual advanced class . So my eleventh	actual	A	A	tn
And then I brought that to my actual life after saying it for so lo	actual	A	A	tn
d one , um , she was actually my actual English advisor . She's like , t	actual	A	A	tn
they were fighting . These were actual like , neighborhoods that were	actual	A	A	tn
we have a mock trial with real actual judges . And they decide what s	actual	A	A	tn
- cause I mean , we just do the actual pulling the pulling the parts	actual	A	A	tn
imagine cause I- I don't have actual facts on this , but like , I kno	actual	A	A	tn
n this side of town versus uh , actual houses like uh , townhouses or	actual	A	A	tn
ember when it- it started , the actual go gos took turn- took a turn	actual	A	A	tn
four hour store used to be an actual Seven Eleven . It has changed d	actual	A	A	tn
rd . I only went to a couple of actual go gos , but I loved the music	actual	A	A	tn
zoo cut ten minutes off of his actual thirty minute set just so peop	actual	A	A	tn
sn't really a a s- s- you know actual seller . You know I was working	actual	A	A	tn
that strong . Yeah . Um , so the actual sauce is just sweet and sour u	actual	A	A	tn
. Um , < ts > but in terms of the actual campus itself , I think that , u	actual	A	A	tn
gnorant thing , versus , like , a actual dialect . Um , yeah . Uh-huh . < la	actual	A	A	tn
r , um , you know , the- the- the actual person who's in charge is in c	actual	A	A	tn
chool . And then you get to the actual building . You're like , where i	actual	A	A	tn
int on the team , he's building actual team like , instead of going af	actual	A	A	tn
n I love mumbo sauce , like the actual sauce is fucking great . Um ( la	actual	A	A	tn
could be closer to the- to the actual tent that the reception was in	actual	A	A	tn
andover's just a city , but the actual neighborhood was Kentland . But	actual	A	A	tn
o bring it out . Instead of the actual inventor . So that's what- I- I	actual	A	A	tn
cause I've never been in- to a actual stadium like that . And going ,	actual	A	A	tn
o go version before I hear the actual artist , who sung the song , or	actual	A	A	tn
almost two years since we- the actual time she got sick , went in the	actual	A	A	tn
l . But I never went to- to the actual clubs . So definitely go go , bu	actual	A	A	tn
is totally different from the actual version . Um , it's more upbeat .	actual	A	A	tn
I'm saying . It's not about my actual- like setting me up for- exact	actual	A	A	tn
e that to make it sound like a actual poem , but like it may not even	actual	A	A	tn
eally like science- Like- like actual science . Psychology is like a	actual	A	A	tn
ide my grandmother house was a actual crackhouse . People would go th	actual	A	A	tn
Like , I loved school . I loved actual school . Like I never hated sch	actual	A	A	tn
over Rigamortus because I'm a actual musician , you know what I'm sa	actual	A	A	tn
knew I wasn't gonna play their actual concert , but I would just sit	actual	A	A	tn
I took the bus for- yeah , the actual school bus . Yeah , yeah , I took	actual	A	A	tn
together . It- it maybe like a actual bass drum that you play in the	actual	A	A	tn
ike I'd be better working with actual patients and like , people who	actual	A	A	tn
ever- um , first and only time actually I ever had to , um , perform CPR	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
eordained by the Gods . So that actually he hadn't tried to change his	actually	R	PREVB	tp

eel that the gentrification is actually good for us , and you know . But	actually	R	PREJJ	tp
o themselves , it's kind of sad actually . Like they kind of just made i	actually	R	POSTJJ	tp
oundary rules ? Because I could actually walk to < school > . But I wanted	actually	R	PREVB	tp
I- I'm actually doing a paper myself on- on my	actually	R	PREVB	tp

s a great learning environment actually . It really was . Um , so for the	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
learned a lot . And I think it actually prepared me in a lot of ways f	actually	R	PREVB	tp
e three days before I would be actually discovered . There was a Jewish	actually	R	PREVB	tp
ly smart enough , or capable of actually achieving success at the schoo	actually	R	PREVB	tp

Um , I did most of my schooling actually , in Oklahoma , my middle school	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
ld even remember cursing . Well actually , I wrote a girl a note cussing	actually	R	PREVB	tp
ke you put ' em on a hill . Well actually , well you kind of have to take	actually	R	PREVB	tp
t in and realized , oh , they're actually , like- this might actually be	actually	R	PREVB	tp
that grandiose , so . We , um , we actually took a bus there , so . Yeah . Th	actually	R	PREVB	tp
t bad to me , you know . Um , I'm actually volunteering for , uh , outreach	actually	R	PREVB	tp
music , so at the time , she was actually , um , trying to manage a little	actually	R	PREVB	tp
e , really , really deep for me , actually saying < name > ENT . That's- tha	actually	R	PREVB	tp
t's- that's actually my blood cousin . On top of tha	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
, I was able to- I was able to actually like do a little cipher with m	actually	R	PREVB	tp
s son . You know , I was able to actually communicate with him . And whic	actually	R	PREVB	tp
ty deep , because < name > he was actually around me when I was a kid . Yo	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
t you don't get yet . Until you actually go through the lyrics in your	actually	R	PREVB	tp
ng to the point where radio is actually playing local artists more . DK	actually	R	PREVB	tp
, colleges and looking at what actually Rochester delivers as far as e	actually	R	PREVB	tp
picnics and stuff . But I like actually went in the trails around the	actually	R	PREVB	tp
Yeah . Right ? School president actually . School . Student body , Excuse	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
wo new dorms . So it was really actually very nice . Um , you know , livin	actually	R	PREJJ	tp
- and like what this child can actually accomplish . So like just being	actually	R	PREVB	tp
t it was like something that I actually cared about . Finally like I ha	actually	R	PREVB	tp
a guy . He's still there , and I actually work with his mom now . His nam	actually	R	PREVB	tp
nish all my necessary steps to actually teach . And it was nothing you	actually	R	PREVB	tp
r a little while . Um , but I've actually been looking at trying to find	actually	R	PREVB	tp
le > < ts > Absolutely , I've been actually looking , um , so , my wife , I wa	actually	R	PREVB	tp
I found them . < ts > Yeah I do , actually . Um , I talk to at least a coup	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
hat she is multilingual . She's actually half Portuguese . She's a inter	actually	R	PREJJ	tp
rtheast Rochester and the area actually has been , um , knocked down and	actually	R	PREVB	tp
forefront . So I went to , uh- I actually was supposed to go to a school	actually	R	PREVB	tp
at . Yeah . And < name > , < name>'s actually my birth stone . Uh , you know w	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
cal , and it was a lot of dance actually . And it was interesting , and i	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
know why anyone would want to actually do that . But , sometimes like ,	actually	R	PREVB	tp
nctional model , that's what it actually takes . So , so that's what I wo	actually	R	PREVB	tp
t about us actual people , that actually live in the city , so . Yeah .	actually	R	PREVB	tp
ng . And , um , I mean , Rochester actually , we made- I think we're like n	actually	R	PREVB	tp
h . And , um , me and my boys was actually like , part of the people who w	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
And like for what ? So , when I actually ended up getting locked up , I '	actually	R	PREVB	tp
ing in and- and showing what's actually happening . And I think that al	actually	R	PREVB	tp
I had- I had one , um , she was actually my actual English advisor . She	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
he like , dove into it . She was actually going for her doctorate at the	actually	R	PREVB	tp
. So seventh grade year , I was actually in the eighth grade class with	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
ou would never work with , like actually in school . So I got to really	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
It's like , run-down houses . I actually wro- ended up writing a poem ,	actually	R	PREVB	tp
ap up at the corner store , was actually like , the drug dealer on the b	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
a black woman educator , I , uh , actually published a chapter about this	actually	R	PREVB	tp
, a- on < address > Court . I was actually born there . I was born on < add	actually	R	PREVB	tp
I heard that song . S- a- no I actually seen the music video I had a ?	actually	R	PREVB	tp
to be repetitive . A- and I'm'a actually think my thoughts out clearly ,	actually	R	PREVB	tp
ink a person might like . I'm'a actually think about what I'm actually	actually	R	PREVB	tp
n't gotta travel to Atlanta to actually hear a Atlanta person . I can j	actually	R	PREVB	tp
bit of the east side . Yes , um , actually , um , I've lived in other citie	actually	R	PREVB	tp
I got towards , uh , high school actually , that's when I came- we came b	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
indset . Once I came back home , actually got a house right across the s	actually	R	PREVB	tp
he Upward Bound is what had me actually express myself and learn how t	actually	R	PREVB	tp
person that I have battled is actually the face of battle rap at this	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
not completely shitty . And it actually is some people's goal to live	actually	R	PREVB	tp
one that was like specifically actually for , like it was supposed to u	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
then- and it's cool that they actually called me and were just like ,	actually	R	PREVB	tp
good place . And then , I still actually was gonna pick St. John Fisher	actually	R	PREVB	tp
ne of my mother's best friends actually had a house in a development a	actually	R	PREVB	tp
in Florida . The other half is actually uh , grew up near Katy Street a	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
I knew what they were doing actually helped me to become a better s	actually	R	PREVB	tp
of , uh , knew that , but , um , it actually helped me , even though , like ,	actually	R	PREVB	tp
or , not necessarily , because I actually knew her from this other progr	actually	R	PREVB	tp
ifficult to get , um , I was- a- actually I had a huge advantage compare	actually	R	PREVB	tp
g in . So , political science a- actually a very quantitative program . A	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
fessor that I would think that actually would believe in my ability to	actually	R	PREVB	tp
maybe one of two . Um , and so , actually , when I came in , like , I came	actually	R	PREVB	tp
ic . And , um , uh , f- folks acs- actually like that , right ? < ts > Well , i	actually	R	PREVB	tp
- in the city , and so the city actually becomes the public market for ,	actually	R	PREVB	tp
y , ooh . < laugh > Yeah . < school > actually . Yeah , so that's why I'm not-	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
e , oh hey what's up ? And like , actually talking to me and not , you kno	actually	R	PREVB	tp
ur , I would not know they were actually in DC . And so it was really co	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
ad to be around that , but do I actually wanna subject myself to that ?	actually	R	PREVB	tp
hly of themself . So like , do I actually wanna be around that ? Uh , um ,	actually	R	PREVB	tp
Washington DC and so , there's actually a lot of < school > st- um , alum	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
And it's- and thankfully it's actually a lot more st- uh , black and L	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
and all these other groups . I actually , went to an event they had , uh	actually	R	PREVB	tp
on't want me there , like I can actually excel here and get something ,	actually	R	PREVB	tp
I'm challenged in that way , it actually- it propels me to work harder ,	actually	R	PREVB	tp
of like , you know , that people actually pay to go to high school , like	actually	R	PREVB	tp
dia Circle , now that's where I actually remember growing up , having bi	actually	R	PREVB	tp
and community leaders need to actually step up and talk to the board	actually	R	PREVB	tp
tudent , I think , actually in that I- when you're able to	actually	R	PREVB	tp
d it's like , no , like , you can actually do objective work and be black	actually	R	PREVB	tp
t was also difficult for me , I actually lost my mother when I was in g	actually	R	PREVB	tp
typically for tenure . And then actually not getting it a lot of times .	actually	R	PREVB	tp
se sectors . And , well , are you actually getting to know the neighborho	actually	R	PREVB	tp
f R . Um . But in terms of , do I actually like , go into the city , I thin	actually	R	PREVB	tp
and just pop out . Um . Which is actually very in- indicative of people	actually	R	PREJJ	tp
sleep with your door open . We actually done that . But you can't do th	actually	R	PREVB	tp
, because you take the time to actually listen to what they're saying ,	actually	R	PREVB	tp
now , my neighbors are great . I actually have , um , kids from RIT next-d	actually	R	PREVB	tp
the fifth grade and , um , I was actually in a class with , um , < ts > spec	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
friends with my boss . Her dad actually worked there . Mm-hm . He worked	actually	R	PREVB	tp
hey bought this house . So they actually bought the house for seventeen	actually	R	PREVB	tp
at . So the very next day- well actually his father , it was a professor	actually	R	PREVB	tp
r not . Or n- no , it's ? really actually not a question of whether you	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
cans and I was one of two that actually lived in Pittsford . Um , the ot	actually	R	PREVB	tp
now . Um , so- and some of them actually don't really know what that me	actually	R	PREVB	tp
ten times so I- it- it's- it's actually really challenging to come hom	actually	R	PREJJ	tp
king , like , these menial jobs , actually made me feel pretty sad . And I	actually	R	PREVB	tp
then , um , in DC I just feel- I actually feel real at home , like , being	actually	R	PREVB	tp
eting or relating to people actually , other black students even som	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
i- privileged backgrounds . And actually had a difficult time , like , me	actually	R	PREVB	tp
from different backgrounds . I actually feel like I didn't relate to a	actually	R	PREVB	tp
bout five , or so months . So , I actually- I finished my dissertation in	actually	R	PREVB	tp
stions , and it's like , no , I'm actually very good , I'm very happy , and	actually	R	PREJJ	tp
your- your ability , which I'm actually okay with , cause people being	actually	R	PREJJ	tp
certain , uh , students of color actually being able to even make it to	actually	R	PREVB	tp
ption of my advisor , there was actually not a lot of senior black prof	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
I was thinking about this , um , actually yesterday . Or like the last fe	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
mething like that . Mm-hm . Well actually yeah . We got some of- members	actually	R	PREVB	tp
mingling with older kids . You actually get the chance to , you know , b	actually	R	PREVB	tp
t's mine . < laugh > Oh yeah . Uh , actually I video tape their games now f	actually	R	PREVB	tp
, so that's how- that's how it actually was at the time . I don't know	actually	R	PREVB	tp
d- and everything , but I never actually been called a name . I guess ca	actually	R	PREVB	tp
ood community you know , people actually ??? and that's good cause I ne	actually	R	PREVB	tp
matter to me . You know . Um , I actually became a firefighter uh , in ni	actually	R	PREVB	tp
know , to make sure that you're actually capable of I guess receiving i	actually	R	PREJJ	tp
know one of many . Uh , we have- actually we do . We have uh , < name > who	actually	R	PREVB	tp
of ' em have some kind of- Well actually . most of them , um , have low IQ	actually	R	PREVB	tp
the lot in ninety days , so um , actually look like the flood basically	actually	R	PREVB	tp
being- uh , seeing it this town actually like it looked . You know , caus	actually	R	PREVB	tp
here and be a part of that is actually amazing . You know ? Uh , so mayb	actually	R	PREJJ	tp
y'll- they'll do that . < laugh > Actually probably when I was- I would s	actually	R	PREVB	tp
urdays and Sundays and I would actually go to church . You know . But , u	actually	R	PREVB	tp
ve been in , my position about- actually eleven years on the fifth of J	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
neteen eighty one uh , actually the- June of nineteen eighty o	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
and all that stuff , so I would actually work at the barn , or what they	actually	R	PREVB	tp
ve . Yeah , yeah . But we did , we actually rented up- I was correct , two	actually	R	PREVB	tp
anics , you have someone that's actually the lead person , and then they	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
ough Friday . And I was able to actually , save money toward getting a c	actually	R	PREVB	tp
boro High School . Yeah , and we actually uh , evacuated them with the fi	actually	R	PREVB	tp
alled ' em and told ' em that- I actually- I went home and changed cloth	actually	R	PREVB	tp
n before and uh- yeah . They're actually a mix . Yeah . They're actually	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
ivorces was- is legal , so . But actually wasn't never married to ' em . C	actually	R	PREVB	tp
ll . Yeah . It's been recovering actually faster than I thought . Cause I	actually	R	PREJJ	tp
ver there too . And , well I was actually a handyman . Had my own slogan .	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
r my belt . I had that well and actually , in high school , they- we had	actually	R	PREVB	tp
the street , Sara Lee . Yeah , so actually at the time it was name Black	actually	R	PREVB	tp
e look at it um < ts > we didn't actually understand the extent of what	actually	R	PREVB	tp
er had . It- it really was . And actually I think that was one of the bi	actually	R	PREVB	tp
oming up poor and been able to actually , afford a couple of new cars .	actually	R	PREVB	tp
out leaving . Cause they didn't actually see the water in their yard . Y	actually	R	PREVB	tp
me , she was sick . And I didn't actually get the phone call- I didn't a	actually	R	PREVB	tp
ad like , fifteen families that actually still there . So they didn't ta	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
n- in a area like that . It was actually the front line . It was very fr	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
in the city limit but we have actually three , Tarboro High , North Edg	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
helping rescue cause that was actually their job . Uh , but we was assi	actually	R	POSTVB	tp
h , Prince Court when we had to actually bring- When we pulled up there	actually	R	PREVB	tp
st attack . < laugh > Yeah , so we actually probably played a major major	actually	R	PREVB	tp
was gonna be easy to play . But actually , I found out , that that's real	actually	R	PREVB	tp
to help them . And that's how I actually basically got into the plumbin	actually	R	PREVB	tp
we actually pack that part up , cause you d	actually	R	PREVB	tp
lly pick up the phone when she actually called me it was on my voicema	actually	R	PREVB	tp
inistrative type , and just not actually packing . Cause those departmen	actually	R	PREVB	tp
t actually pack it up . The aviation part ,	actually	R	PREVB	tp
d- g- the person that hired me actually was one of the people that mov	actually	R	PREVB	tp
you know , so . But she- She was adamant on me going to < school > and I	adamant	A	A	tn
il , I think it was folks being adamant about assimilating . Um , and I	adamant	A	A	tn
posed to be across from there , additional housing . Mm-hm . Right . That's	additional	A	A	tn
ant he got we're gonna do some additional senior citizen housing area . O	additional	A	A	tn
d regular classes and I can do additional stuff on my own , I don't need	additional	A	A	tn
not gonna come to me with any additional cost that you want me to take	additional	A	A	tn
nsidering uh giving the < work > adequate funds to accommodate at least	adequate	A	A	tn
ssistant I moved into like uh , administrative coordinator , office manager an	administrative	A	A	tn
. < laugh > Yes , yes . < ts > I was administrative assistant in um , DC public sch	administrative	A	A	tn
of the areas is more just like administrative type , and just not actually pa	administrative	A	A	tn
he executive as- the executive administrative assistant to the regional vice	administrative	A	A	tn
d my original position was the administrative analyst , which kind of phased	administrative	A	A	tn
, evolving , and so I went from administrative coordinator the um , event mana	administrative	A	A	tn
go games are just fun . They're adorable , and funny , and like , you can '	adorable	A	A	tn
ke it . Maybe people think it's adorable , oh it's so cute . N- it's not .	adorable	A	A	tn
not be impacted , uh , you know , adversely , uh , by , uh , a lot of decision	adversely	R	POSTVB	tp
od with history , so . It's like aesthetic purposes as to why I would lik	aesthetic	A	A	tn
f the night . She is , uh , known affectionately in my memory as Lavender Girl .	affectionately	R	POSTVB	tp
didn't believe in so much uh , affirmative action in terms of like you kn	affirmative	A	A	tn
n- it was fun . But now it's so aggravating , because my mom like , no you d	aggravating	A	A	tn
was telling her , her voice was aggravating and stuff . So I was like , oh m	aggravating	A	A	tn
and I mean , that was a- it was aggravating to me cause , you know , the- th	aggravating	A	A	tn
ernal defense when something's aggressive like a dog or something . It mi	aggressive	A	A	tn
ediately jumping to like being aggressive . So I'm thinking about that ri	aggressive	A	A	tn
um , go go was always a really aggressive music , um , and so the horns an	aggressive	A	A	tn
like civility . But , it's like aggressive civility . I think is the way t	aggressive	A	A	tn
ve a dog . < laugh > < laugh > He's aggressive . But he's , uh- How's that expe	aggressive	A	A	tn
ecurity gonna be a little more aggressive . So things like that won't- Ca	aggressive	A	A	tn

e school teams , and there were certain schools that had special and u	certain	A	A	tn
ant is ran , people only expect certain stuff from that . So if we kind	certain	A	A	tn
exactly . But the catch is , on certain occasions if , um , if one perso	certain	A	A	tn
were young , you know , after a certain time when- you know , when- whe	certain	A	A	tn

a lot of that poverty raised a certain amount o- a certain a- type of	certain	A	A	tn
t of prejudice going on out in certain parts of Virginia so I try to	certain	A	A	tn
ke- it's just only , like , with certain words , or- but they kn- they k	certain	A	A	tn
ommy . < laugh > Ye- I mean , it's certain things that we have to instill	certain	A	A	tn

ut I still had to be home at a certain time , I still had- Y- yeah . < t	certain	A	A	tn

we- me and her never like got close a long time ago until recently	close	A	A	tn

Plus I'm trying to become more comfortable with change since I'm about to	comfortable	A	A	tn
But as a parent , I don't feel comfortable with putting my fifteen year o	comfortable	A	A	tn
time . But- but try and find a comfortable neighborhood . You know , and- a	comfortable	A	A	tn
o my last house so I will feel comfortable in it . And she did . To a T . < l	comfortable	A	A	tn
ed and be friends and still be comfortable and not always have somebody o	comfortable	A	A	tn
back on and I got a little bit comfortable . But believe me , it was fright	comfortable	A	A	tn
stent in terms of where I feel comfortable . It- when I lived in DC , I liv	comfortable	A	A	tn
l I had you know , my people is comfortable and not myself . Then I go out	comfortable	A	A	tn
o anything that's- that I feel comfortable with , so whether that be my mo	comfortable	A	A	tn
nd people that I knew and felt comfortable with . I never really ventured	comfortable	A	A	tn
g the way I did , I didn't feel comfortable going down- Cause it- it was s	comfortable	A	A	tn
st so you can breathe and feel comfortable about yourself , then it means	comfortable	A	A	tn
so people would be more- more comfortable to move so we can build up . Wh	comfortable	A	A	tn
r me t- just to kind of um , be comfortable in my own skin . So um , anyway .	comfortable	A	A	tn
And actually I felt a lot more comfortable being with a band that was fro	comfortable	A	A	tn
loner , just . And I- I- I feel comfortable just- just having my own space	comfortable	A	A	tn
ffic , enough where my mom felt comfortable with uh , me , you know , being a	comfortable	A	A	tn
en the two . Um , and in my most comfortable space , I think it's somewhere	comfortable	A	A	tn
imes , as I got , you know , more comfortable with her working , she would le	comfortable	A	A	tn
t of the reason is didn't feel comfortable going to ' em , felt like I was	comfortable	A	A	tn
. You gonna feel a little more comfortable with- if you got some men with	comfortable	A	A	tn
and things that people are not comfortable with saying out loud . But at t	comfortable	A	A	tn
you go in . But pick a- pick a comfortable place to live , so when you s-	comfortable	A	A	tn
rted to see people become more comfortable in their lifestyles . Because t	comfortable	A	A	tn
t the f- like , but not feeling comfortable asking a health teacher or any	comfortable	A	A	tn
ke sure the um , passengers are comfortable . Make sure they get what the w	comfortable	A	A	tn
etter RA just because I'm more comfortable interacting with all these res	comfortable	A	A	tn
good at helping people and I'm comfortable doing that . Um , and I didn't m	comfortable	A	A	tn
ife that white people are more comfortable with darker skin black people .	comfortable	A	A	tn
o get to the point where she's comfortable talking about anything , includ	comfortable	A	A	tn
all that I had already become comfortable in a- in a positive light of b	comfortable	A	A	tn
ving the life I want and c- as comfortable as I want . As in , not like and	comfortable	A	A	tn
me . Um , and I just feel really comfortable there . Mm . Yeah . Everyone's al	comfortable	A	A	tn
here . So there- I'm safe . I'm comfortable here . I'm not , you know- Where	comfortable	A	A	tn
nd so if I'm somewhere and I'm comfortable , it comes out . But when I'm co	comfortable	A	A	tn
upid ? Like , if I'm at home and comfortable , okay , it's one thing for me t	comfortable	A	A	tn
like , I don't- I wouldn't feel comfortable with a junior high school stud	comfortable	A	A	tn
know , I like to live in a nice comfortable neighborhood . That's how it al	comfortable	A	A	tn
ike , not- my struggle in being comfortable with me not fitting in . < ts > U	comfortable	A	A	tn
as our high school , so . I felt comfortable there . And in my mind it was g	comfortable	A	A	tn
e ? I'd tell you pick a- pick a comfortable neighborhood , and , uh , uh , mak	comfortable	A	A	tn
re of people , seeing that they comfortable . You know . I have a lot of pat	comfortable	A	A	tn
of like to keep him where he's comfortable . And when he gets out of schoo	comfortable	A	A	tn
and a place to feel like I was comfortable . I reme- I remember coming in	comfortable	A	A	tn
s the reason why she felt more comfortable living on the Lower East Side ,	comfortable	A	A	tn
I like this area . It's really comfortable and nice . I feel like it's- ju	comfortable	A	A	tn
me to find a place where I was comfortable . And that's here . Where I see	comfortable	A	A	tn
make my family very happy and comfortable . And donate to others and save	comfortable	A	A	tn
to get- I mean I had to become comfortable with who I am over time . < laug	comfortable	A	A	tn
e . Like , cop cars are just not comfortable . And me being the person I am ,	comfortable	A	A	tn
ay sometimes that's not always comfortable . Exactly . It's not . I mean loo	comfortable	A	A	tn
s- to make sure everybody was comfortable . So the- most of the strain wa	comfortable	A	A	tn
I do , like I think , people are comfortable . Like , letting me be that . < ts	comfortable	A	A	tn
t- I- with m- with me becoming comfortable in who I am , I just had to be	comfortable	A	A	tn
ondering why do they feel that comfortable to live here ? Cause I- me pers	comfortable	A	A	tn
hop Six . So , basically getting comfortable , and they're hav- they have me	comfortable	A	A	tn
grow . Because when you become comfortable , you c- become stagnant , and y	comfortable	A	A	tn
h > I have become comfortable in my own skin . < laugh > So um-	comfortable	A	A	tn
e being who they are and being comfortable that they gonna have opinions	comfortable	A	A	tn
ace to live you know , and live comfortably in- in the community where you	comfortably	R	POSTVB	tp

ss , we were- we had so- we had completely different- I think we- we didn	completely	R	PREVB	tp
t . Right . I get it . I get that completely . Gotta smother like that , mm-m	completely	R	POSTVB	tp
just like the quality is just completely different . And around that tim	completely	R	PREJJ	tp
ducation again or do something completely different . And I have a lot of	completely	R	PREJJ	tp
urday on < address > , and that's completely out of her comfort zone . She l	completely	R	POSTVB	tp

dwell you know , it's complete- completely different type of school and e	completely	R	PREJJ	tp

t in my eleventh grade year , I completely lost my mind and thought that	completely	R	PREVB	tp
hours . Tylenol knocked me out completely , and that- to this day I have	completely	R	POSTVB	tp
rned it a- it turned it around completely . And uh , the car flipped on th	completely	R	POSTVB	tp
on't . Or I don't believe in it completely , I'll say that . Because I thin	completely	R	POSTVB	tp
got probably a foot from being completely to the ceiling inside the fire	completely	R	POSTVB	tp
ulture of what it is now , it's completely different from how it was when	completely	R	PREJJ	tp
r so in high school , I drifted completely away from them because I went	completely	R	POSTVB	tp
So far . Um . When that changes completely , then I'll be ready to leave .	completely	R	POSTVB	tp
got to the playground , we were completely over it . We forgotten all abou	completely	R	POSTVB	tp
but not le- is it legal ? Like , completely legal in DC ? Yeah , and it's pe	completely	R	PREJJ	tp
man who did the murdering was completely sick . Course , this was suppose	completely	R	PREJJ	tp

who he is now I guess is like completely different . Um , he doesn't have	completely	R	PREJJ	tp
w , they might not remember you completely but they remember some things	completely	R	POSTVB	tp
t I was- I mean , I- it- it was completely different from my mom's place .	completely	R	PREJJ	tp
ind of said the culture's just completely different from- they didn't- t	completely	R	PREJJ	tp
s > you know , we're f- from two completely different , you know- they're n	completely	R	PREJJ	tp
e . My social life was cut down completely . Probably because of the work	completely	R	POSTVB	tp
is , um , and it's- plus it was completely different from what , you know ,	completely	R	PREJJ	tp
it's like , bye . And that , like completely messes you up . < ts > So , it's n	completely	R	PREVB	tp
' re like , oh . But now it looks completely different and like , I think th	completely	R	PREJJ	tp
fferent area , but Northwest is completely different . Every time I go the	completely	R	PREJJ	tp
know why . They do s- c- s- two completely different things . But there wa	completely	R	PREJJ	tp
as around the way . And she was completely against it because she knew of	completely	R	POSTVB	tp
portunities , she- she was like completely against that . She was like h-	completely	R	POSTVB	tp
it was . You know , and to just completely disregard them as if they were	completely	R	PREVB	tp

. And I realized that it's not completely shitty . And it actually is som	completely	R	PREJJ	tp
ever feel that you have things completely to your satisfaction . It doesn	completely	R	POSTVB	tp
k anybody really be recognized completely as having valid arguments , val	completely	R	POSTVB	tp
at this point , if I can't be a completely good person and just try this	completely	R	NPAM	tp

nch of half way decent kids go completely bad ? So they took us under the	completely	R	PREJJ	tp

Anyway . Yeah . That was a whole confusing situation there um , as a- as a	confusing	A	A	tn
Where you're from . Yeah . It's confusing . And then you- You got to know	confusing	A	A	tn
I see . ( breathy ) Why is it so confusing ? Oh , there it is . Not a proble	confusing	A	A	tn

na do . And it's really a- a- a conscious choice . Like , it's hard , like ,	conscious	A	A	tn
, it's- it's his message . It's conscious relevant message music . You kn	conscious	A	A	tn
thing on my mind is let me be conscious of where I go because I'm worr	conscious	A	A	tn
know , I- I w- I was , you know , conscious for about a hour , you know . An	conscious	A	A	tn

e liked being looked up to , so consequently , he fell into the- After tryin	consequently	R	PREVB	tp
I think that , some of them are conservative . I think the majority of them	conservative	A	A	tn

ike some cons- they have these conservative views . I'm like you you a blac	conservative	A	A	tn

go music is basically a beat a constant beat . And um , < ts > I don't kno	constant	A	A	tn
is- not necessarily , change is constant . Um , < ts > I- I- I just wish th	constant	A	A	tn

eing around food , and having a creative mind and- and the different th	creative	A	A	tn
' m inspired by when I teach my creative writing song , I tell my studen	creative	A	A	tn
who does that , cause we have a creative writing degree now at < school >	creative	A	A	tn

ike the places where we can be creative and like share our arts , enjoy	creative	A	A	tn
all , um , because I'm creative writing . And so I cover- some	creative	A	A	tn

xperiencing people using their creative juices to come up with somethi	creative	A	A	tn

break it down . So I was doing creative things at the uh , youth minist	creative	A	A	tn
arted losing its um , creativi- creative edge and a- and original edge	creative	A	A	tn
song sounds the same . Gotta be creative if you wanna keep attention lo	creative	A	A	tn
particular type of like really creative-style , really skilled poem . An	creative	A	A	tn
ust like to be the- uh , use my creative side of my mind on all of thes	creative	A	A	tn
' s not just one , so . Yeah , I'm creative , artistic arts- artsy , fartsy	creative	A	A	tn
ally really dove into like , my creative expression with my words , and	creative	A	A	tn
So I basically was overseeing creative elements for the youth ministr	creative	A	A	tn
, creative writing- this poetry professor	creative	A	A	tn
ea- my bachelor's degree is in creative writing . And I remember my , uh	creative	A	A	tn
what music is . You just being creative and doing your art . Like your	creative	A	A	tn
and or Virginia . You were more credible somehow , you were more cool so	credible	A	A	tn
my , uh , bachelor's degree , in criminal justice , that I would enroll i	criminal	A	A	tn
ou would swear I did something criminal . Like , how tight the handcuffs	criminal	A	A	tn
rst time ever . And was nothing criminal . Ended up being I had a- um , I	criminal	A	A	tn
blacks- make sure blacks got a criminal record at an early age so they	criminal	A	A	tn
my brother's friends at first . Criminal Justice . Mm-hm . I'm still purs	criminal	A	A	tn
s > < school > , I enrolled in the criminal justice program . And I got , uh	criminal	A	A	tn
ug abuse , drug dealing , crime , criminal , gun shots here and there . And	criminal	A	A	tn
to it . I was just drawn to the criminal justice . I wanted to do more ,	criminal	A	A	tn
eah . I know . I know . I went to criminal justice . ( laughing ) I don't kn	criminal	A	A	tn
at kept me from doing a lot of criminal activity that a lot of my frie	criminal	A	A	tn
ssion , uh , uh , around the , uh , criminal justice system incarcer- incar	criminal	A	A	tn
. It's been prone to have some criminal activity happening . And so we	criminal	A	A	tn
ing drugs , people that were in criminal activity , they're now , you kno	criminal	A	A	tn
hat I criti- I learned to be a critical thinker . You know , and I wish	critical	A	A	tn
that they say to c- you know , critical thinking . You know , but they h	critical	A	A	tn
, you know , so . Yes . Yes . That critical thinking , you know , we were ab	critical	A	A	tn
s head hit a tree . And he's in critical condition and this is a point-	critical	A	A	tn
chester and not really looking critically at some of the stuff that was	critically	R	POSTVB	tp
, cause that's- that's- that's crucial right now . That's a lot of mon	crucial	A	A	tn
ween them years those our most crucial . Um , I lost- well , I lost- I l	crucial	A	A	tn
ent spending that something as crucial as snow removal for us to be f	crucial	A	A	tn
it's like , you have all these cruel people , not- and I don't wish	cruel	A	A	tn
ause some of the students are cruel towards the teachers . And then	cruel	A	A	tn
some of ' em really have to be cruel towards some of the students c	cruel	A	A	tn

ive in , they were targeted for cruel treatment , um , uh , misappropri	cruel	A	A	tn
t the growth of you know black cultural um , expansion in Pittsburgh wh	cultural	A	A	tn

the bar mitzvah's cultural and religious . So anyway , they	cultural	A	A	tn
eferences , which are obviously cultural references , but it's boring . I	cultural	A	A	tn
accent . Like , that's- that's a cultural norm , because you don't like t	cultural	A	A	tn
e this . Like the artsy , weird , cultural more cultural places like , yea	cultural	A	A	tn
as religious- It might just be cultural . The- the- the bat mitzvah and	cultural	A	A	tn
t from all the different like , cultural , uh , viewpoints . Um , we watche	cultural	A	A	tn
V testing . < ts > Uh , but I plan cultural and fun events , uh , where we o	cultural	A	A	tn
Uh , one group went in for more cultural activities like going to a nic	cultural	A	A	tn
movie , um , sometimes we go to cultural functions . < laugh > If we find	cultural	A	A	tn
u just- it's just one of those cultural things to DC that you just gro	cultural	A	A	tn
go along with this . So it was cultural . I don't know what the Hispani	cultural	A	A	tn

t got something done then it's cute , or it's perfect , or it's fly .	cute	A	A	tn
board , it's gonna be even more dangerous . Um , ( breathy ) I mean , first o	dangerous	A	A	tn
then . You know , I'm already a dangerous guy . So when I really get that	dangerous	A	A	tn
ere on Ninth and O , which is a dangerous place . I don't even hang out a	dangerous	A	A	tn
ticular group because it was a dangerous situation you know between- wi	dangerous	A	A	tn
r to get it fixed because it's dangerous . And so the dog , he um- he too	dangerous	A	A	tn
ne and the blue line . Both are dangerous . Red line , yeah but far as lik	dangerous	A	A	tn
' t used very widely cause it's dangerous . And the captain had to okay i	dangerous	A	A	tn
y city you live in , it's- it's dangerous . New York City is horrible , bu	dangerous	A	A	tn
go on horseback ., because too dangerous , and they always carry the hig	dangerous	A	A	tn
stuff that was more- that was dangerous for the kids to hang outside .	dangerous	A	A	tn
, sometimes if you come from a dangerous background , you so used to see	dangerous	A	A	tn
So , < exhale > I'm'a say it was dangerous , but it's not as da- it wasn't	dangerous	A	A	tn
gonna say , oh , Park Ave , it's dangerous . But it's smack dab in the mid	dangerous	A	A	tn
he world . But we would d- do a dangerous thing . We would see who could	dangerous	A	A	tn
ou know what I mean , stuff got dangerous at the same time , you know . Bu	dangerous	A	A	tn
as dangerous as it is now . It's like the ki	dangerous	A	A	tn
high school because it's- it's dangerous . I'm just like , oh my god you	dangerous	A	A	tn
ut uh , I never been in a- that dangerous of a situation where I thought	dangerous	A	A	tn
n over there . It's- it's- it's dangerous . Like , too many things and I'm	dangerous	A	A	tn
y , like our project was really dangerous , but to us kids , it was awesom	dangerous	A	A	tn
It's kind of dangerous over there , but um , they just	dangerous	A	A	tn
' ve had- I've been in a lot of dangerous situations . Not-not to die , bu	dangerous	A	A	tn
It's kind of it's kind of , um , dangerous . Or something to that effect .	dangerous	A	A	tn
some people would say a little dangerous , always . And then when I , um ,	dangerous	A	A	tn
you are going to do something dangerous or bad just by your presence .	dangerous	A	A	tn
hing to do , but it was just so dangerous in the nineties . So it is a bl	dangerous	A	A	tn
hing , because DC was very very dangerous at one point . It really was . M	dangerous	A	A	tn
eason at all . It was just that dangerous . And I ca- I do see a change ,	dangerous	A	A	tn
you walk , you're going through dangerous neighborhoods . Um . That type o	dangerous	A	A	tn
into DC because to them it was dangerous . Um , and then DC they didn't g	dangerous	A	A	tn
ut also because he thinks it's dangerous . And my mother says uh that uh	dangerous	A	A	tn
Yep . But we shouldn't- It was dangerous , I will admit in a sense that	dangerous	A	A	tn
the first floor window , wasn't dangerous or anything . Um , and I went ho	dangerous	A	A	tn
and I think that's a very very dangerous thing particularly for New Yor	dangerous	A	A	tn
cross the street was extremely dangerous at night . Lot of drug use , a l	dangerous	A	A	tn
livid . Because you know it was dangerous , and he had her child out ther	dangerous	A	A	tn
- I think this neighborhood is dangerously um , on the- one the edge of be	dangerously	R	POSTVB	tp
ast person would always make a daring run for it , trying to run the	daring	A	A	tn
r . She's not bad looking for a dark skinned child . You hear those	dark	A	A	tn
him , and my father's real real dark , so my mother said , hey black	dark	A	A	tn
ock or something , after it got dark . Dark . And um we fished for aw	dark	A	A	tn
the bushes and most likely as dark as it was , they wouldn't be ab	dark	A	A	tn
l or something for , til it got dark , and then we had to go in . Wel	dark	A	A	tn
r . I was a black mother , and a dark black mother . You know , it was	dark	A	A	tn
light in there . You go into a dark building at night , has a lot o	dark	A	A	tn
nd forget where you came in . A dark building at nights , of course ,	dark	A	A	tn
as black . Cause her mother was dark , real dark . Yeah the teacher w	dark	A	A	tn
w , slavery and the light skin , dark skin thing , and all of that , t	dark	A	A	tn
and it was because I was in a dark place , and like , I remember we	dark	A	A	tn
t stars , planets , empty space , dark space , all of this is k- smash	dark	A	A	tn
public . Um , she was a um , < ts > dark brown skinned girl . I was a li	dark	A	A	tn
in the- even though things are dark nowadays , I'm the person that	dark	A	A	tn
t over there and it got really dark at night , so . We used to run p	dark	A	A	tn

the book is a little uh , more descriptive , much more descriptive , than t	descriptive	A	A	tn

when- whenever we were really desperate for - for somebody to play it-	desperate	A	A	tn
erything else , and everybody's desperate to try to find a way to- to- t	desperate	A	A	tn
it's j- it's that- DC is that desperate . DC offer all kinds of money t	desperate	A	A	tn
your emotions . You're putting destructive out in the world . It's like a	destructive	A	A	tn

e days uh they look for things destructive instead of you know constructi	destructive	A	A	tn
. I'm'a aks you- I'm just- I'm determined- yeah I'm determined- I'm dete	determined	A	A	tn
ommon Ground . Common Ground is determined to get rid of housing . I mean ,	determined	A	A	tn

and R cause R kind of is like diagonal . And there were these three ho	diagonal	A	A	tn
ou gotta make that arc or that diagonal , but . Mm-hm . Right . Mm-hm , yea	diagonal	A	A	tn
t in box one , box two was like diagonally across this thing that we'd dr	diagonally	R	POSTVB	tp
realize that you know , we were different . And , you know , and we were tr	different	A	A	tn
I wasn't used to living around different people of different cultures a	different	A	A	tn
to uh , see new people and- and different people you don't see during th	different	A	A	tn
around , you know , bringing up different things , like narcotics things	different	A	A	tn
what they believe in , and it's different from what they believe in . So	different	A	A	tn
ice . You know , they have different lo meins and vegetables and st	different	A	A	tn
ome together as a family . Just different beliefs can separate a family .	different	A	A	tn
, and we would- uh , uh , we had different areas we had to pick up the ki	different	A	A	tn
cause of job opportunities and different things at the time , so most of	different	A	A	tn
very day , it- I grew up with a different perspective I guess . So my gra	different	A	A	tn
how do you live with people of different races , different creeds , diffe	different	A	A	tn
nd different races . And all of them looking	different	A	A	tn
s and stuff . So I think that's different , you know , ( laughing ) cause I	different	A	A	tn
rst time , it was great . It was different scenery . I didn't know it was	different	A	A	tn
where they taught me how to do different types of flips that I could do	different	A	A	tn
ey're- der- they're definitely different , but with a call center , you r	different	A	A	tn
neighbors were black . Now it's different . Now , you know , it's- they're	different	A	A	tn
ide , but I've lived , um , three different places in my life growing up ,	different	A	A	tn
but back in those days it was different . Probably just like I say , a t	different	A	A	tn
ot to participate in all these different programs . The public school sy	different	A	A	tn
nt south . And it was a totally different world . I remember going with m	different	A	A	tn
Go go music , um , it's just b- different bands , um , doing their variati	different	A	A	tn
ow what I mean ? So it's like a different- different styles of music . Li	different	A	A	tn
wanna get stabbed . I ain't no different from nobody . I just learned to	different	A	A	tn
, you appear that you a little different from everybody else . There's a	different	A	A	tn
u walk out the door , there's a different story , I'm doing what I'm doin	different	A	A	tn
you cross that doorstep it's a different story . And that's why I don't	different	A	A	tn
ou know , when you see a lot of different things , now I wish I had waite	different	A	A	tn
ing your back . It ain't no different , man , and back then- Just like	different	A	A	tn
same field but doing something different in the same field I took up be	different	A	A	tn
me , remember , there were other different ethnic groups . Those ethnic gr	different	A	A	tn
be confined to restrictions of different things just by somebody's beli	different	A	A	tn
d someone on his side . Was two different teams , you know , and it was si	different	A	A	tn
ly , it ain't no different . It's hot . You know , you break	different	A	A	tn
yalty- It's like last year , is different now . That's why I use the word	different	A	A	tn
sta- stability . That's different . Loyalty , gonna be there where	different	A	A	tn
feel like I- we have all these different places . Within the school , in	different	A	A	tn
though a lot of people had um , different ways of training their dogs . L	different	A	A	tn
ned was- I know it was totally different . Um , it was a Friday night , I	different	A	A	tn
ia . It's co- it was completely different . My grandfather , he worked for	different	A	A	tn
ike it was- it- it was- it was different in Alexandria . It was still li	different	A	A	tn
race thing it's just like the different areas to us , it kind of blends	different	A	A	tn
s where they can see it from a different perspective . A lot of times th	different	A	A	tn
uch different response . So with like , the w-	different	A	A	tn
ut it was- it was just- it was different . It wasn't like a whole bunch	different	A	A	tn
to , um , you know , just a whole different set of things . Because now PG	different	A	A	tn
one of those last stops it's a different- like I'm talking about differ	different	A	A	tn
know what I mean , sw- slightly different approach . And you will get a m	different	A	A	tn
ent , it's a whole different mindset . It's like , let me pay	different	A	A	tn
u even see your paycheck . It's different as a entrepreneur . It's differ	different	A	A	tn
the time to- to give them that different mindset , to actually instill t	different	A	A	tn
have a different life . And that's the problem .	different	A	A	tn
knew that there w- there is a different way of living , that you could	different	A	A	tn
le that come to DC for so many different reasons . So many different rea	different	A	A	tn
or every like- almost at every different area . So , it was like , you kno	different	A	A	tn
ked on as if it's no better or different from the projects , right ? I th	different	A	A	tn
didn't , but I think that it's different . I'm trying to figure out how .	different	A	A	tn
English language comes from a different , couple of different places . O	different	A	A	tn
trict on my mother's side with different things . Like the church my gra	different	A	A	tn
at argument ? It's a little bit different from a book because you have t	different	A	A	tn
you know . And then when we go different places no one now allowed to w	different	A	A	tn
It ain't no different . I mean- I mean really and tru	different	A	A	tn
really and truly . It ain't no different . < ts > Exactly . Yeah . It isn't-	different	A	A	tn
tter . You know , so it ain't no different . Back then , they probably paid	different	A	A	tn
t . They distribute food to um , different centers like um , Burger King ,	different	A	A	tn
uh- and the country was a lot different , you know , cause we basically	different	A	A	tn
and we go out and you know the different places . And usually I don't ce	different	A	A	tn
don me ? Oh you can tell by the different species of uh snakes because I	different	A	A	tn
drums , guitar , bass . It's just different instruments , um , and just show	different	A	A	tn
suckers . No it's dif- entirely different from shucking corn . But < laugh	different	A	A	tn
s just tight to be able to see different people playing different instr	different	A	A	tn
, younger people have that uh , different type mind than- than- than- th	different	A	A	tn
his whole farm , which a lot of different black neighbors work on this f	different	A	A	tn
e you meet some other kids and different people . Uh , < address > in Speed	different	A	A	tn
we didn't- couldn't afford all different stuff . So < clears throat > we u	different	A	A	tn
e winter , chicken pot pie , all different type of way you can cook chick	different	A	A	tn
it's just the taste , and it's different- it's different styles of mumb	different	A	A	tn
o sauce in the area , too . Like different places make better mumbo sauce	different	A	A	tn
ht have a little spice to ' em , different places you might go to , but fo	different	A	A	tn
had firemans spread out in all different areas . You know , we'd just go-	different	A	A	tn
ou know , uh- that- that gun is different cause it's a- that was a big g	different	A	A	tn
ar , and , um , packing up books , different- lot of stuff like that . And ,	different	A	A	tn
ce that time , s- some moved or different places , you know , like that . Y	different	A	A	tn
on there to you know- di- went different places . They finally put it ba	different	A	A	tn
w , when we were fighting- your different places . Well , well then , when ,	different	A	A	tn
ible because someone's skin is different , but it's something wrong with	different	A	A	tn
nt of language . I think couple different things stand out . Especially f	different	A	A	tn
lly . They're not really on two different sides of the city . They like w	different	A	A	tn
iously they lived in a totally different time frame , so if you- you can	different	A	A	tn
was there for four years ! Very different . < laugh > Uh- Uh- < school > < lau	different	A	A	tn
end . And so that was- It was a different experience . It was great . No ,	different	A	A	tn
hing from them . That's kind of different than us being in our taxi cab ,	different	A	A	tn
t all my sorority sisters from different places . So we would alternate	different	A	A	tn
every year they would go to a different part of ??. And then Club Afri	different	A	A	tn
que , where they would go to a different part of Africa . When I decided	different	A	A	tn
grade . Mm-hm . Yes . Completely different because being at < school > , I w	different	A	A	tn
d beat- And he went to a whole different school . And another girl in my	different	A	A	tn
olle . The book gives you um , a different way of thinking- expanding you	different	A	A	tn
t to the < school > . I went to a different high school than she did but t	different	A	A	tn
for < name > . And so she looked different . And so , we c- Jelly was just	different	A	A	tn
ut < laugh > Yeah . < laugh > I- I- different . Mm-hm . Right . It's the weirde	different	A	A	tn
iends would- would dress up in different outfits and go around the neig	different	A	A	tn
just keep repeating all these different rules . Much more interesting t	different	A	A	tn
he stuff that they'd left at a different place , and uh , they got caught	different	A	A	tn
one this year . Yeah . But it's different now , and I'm not into the club	different	A	A	tn
all the Ya- you can set it to different age groups . So , like you can d	different	A	A	tn
nd I guess she felt like I was different from that . I mean once that ha	different	A	A	tn
know , he was hunting you know , different men , and he had this Mexican f	different	A	A	tn
straight . Um , we did a lot of different things that most schools in De	different	A	A	tn
est is s- well was , cause it's different now , was just as bad as Southe	different	A	A	tn

wanted to experience something different . I wanted to know what it was	different	A	A	tn
stuff like that . Um , what was different for me for them ? Like the way	different	A	A	tn
cause I had friends in all the different types of gangs . I necessarily	different	A	A	tn
mentality from us is extremely different . I know New York f- New York d	different	A	A	tn

ike here . There's just so many different things to enjoy here , whether	different	A	A	tn
' s a lot of diversity and just different things you wouldn't really see	different	A	A	tn

DC . Like , when we go out f- to different states , people- I'll say Fores	different	A	A	tn
helping hand to will look very different than you . They will either be	different	A	A	tn
side of the city . It's- it's a different take depending on where you co	different	A	A	tn

Morgan was really popular for different go go bands . And they play all	different	A	A	tn

al entrepreneurs that are from different races and not just African Ame	different	A	A	tn
ferent races , different parts of the country . It's alm	different	A	A	tn
y because you have people from different , um , economic backgrounds , dif	different	A	A	tn
< school > and being exposed to different ethnicities kind of prepared m	different	A	A	tn
be a chameleon and blend with different people . One thing that really	different	A	A	tn
Um , Virginia is- was a little different than Maryland and DC in terms	different	A	A	tn
to stay outside . It does feel different . Like , it feels- I mean , maybe	different	A	A	tn

telling you like , oh no , it's different other places , and it's not lik	different	A	A	tn
ing through the community in a different way . I think sometimes we beco	different	A	A	tn
y , but tha- but that's still a different beast . And- and so , it was ver	different	A	A	tn
lack and- and our cultures are different . Our backgrounds and- and you	different	A	A	tn
you were taught is completely different than what you're looking at . U	different	A	A	tn
-A-K- C-K Um , BLACK . which was different from black pride . But , um . I s	different	A	A	tn
ayed sports in all of the- all different places . So , um , I've heard it	different	A	A	tn
hink , um , Rochester's a little different from- I think it's just- I- I	different	A	A	tn
don't think our accents are different around here . < clears throat > I	different	A	A	tn
our usage of words is a little different . You know , like , we say pop he	different	A	A	tn

uburban accent that's a little different . < ts > Um , I don't think it's a	different	A	A	tn
d here forever out . And it's a different kind of ownership that I'm fee	different	A	A	tn
and- and Stanton Road was much different , see ? You- you couldn't do tha	different	A	A	tn
you know go go , it stands from different age groups , so like I said , be	different	A	A	tn
ding newspaper , I picked up on different type of things . So , I mean , it	different	A	A	tn
selling crack and selling like different drugs and all that . My father '	different	A	A	tn
elf . And yeah . It just- it was different . No but I'm looking for jobs n	different	A	A	tn
to be successful , it's a whole different ball game cause I don't have-	different	A	A	tn
there with her it's gonna be a different thing . But now I just tell her	different	A	A	tn
u had to protect yourself it's different but now , like I got in a alter	different	A	A	tn
if you come to DC like from a different place you're like , oh DC is li	different	A	A	tn
look out there now like , it's different . So that's why I like reading	different	A	A	tn
back with my mom , it was a bit different , because she didn't really und	different	A	A	tn
, uh , restaurants and a lot of different stuff over there . Um , but yeah	different	A	A	tn
s was connected . It just- it's different cause you like- like if you te	different	A	A	tn
happen outside of school it's different . But in school like we'll be c	different	A	A	tn
rt . They showed- they- t- it's different telling you- telling- it's dif	different	A	A	tn
u uh- s- sometimes , you get in different- you spread out . And you do di	different	A	A	tn
k . Then so , whenever there's a different- Like there's a man on , he'll	different	A	A	tn
I have like , people from like , different places . Like I got Italian in	different	A	A	tn
dmother how come my hair looks different from everybody else's . They wa	different	A	A	tn
s like , because you have different like , culture in your family .	different	A	A	tn
h , basically . But I've been to different places . Like I been to Florida	different	A	A	tn
And then I started to go to i- different schools like , < school > . That w	different	A	A	tn
t have , but- but- you know , on different occasions but I don't remember	different	A	A	tn
nd he used to go around to the different playgrounds , and I remember ge	different	A	A	tn
e than the other . Yeah < laugh > different . It's like- It's more qu- it's	different	A	A	tn
taking things . Mm . Yeah . It's different . Like Eighth Street over on th	different	A	A	tn
um , and it was- it's just way different now and like the types of stor	different	A	A	tn
now I guess is like completely different . Um , he doesn't have very many	different	A	A	tn
t because I can dib and dab in different choices of hip-hop . You know ,	different	A	A	tn
perfect mixture of sauce , like different sauces to me in my opinion , an	different	A	A	tn
know what I mean ? So it was a different- She wasn't as elitist . And th	different	A	A	tn
d she got invited . But she was different kind of Jewish because she liv	different	A	A	tn
neighborhood , which is totally different than the way my- my daughter i	different	A	A	tn
m . Um , and all the houses were different . There were no h- no house- Th	different	A	A	tn
houses . All the houses looked different . You know , they had big yards .	different	A	A	tn
. And uh , I self taught myself different ways . Like , I became more stre	different	A	A	tn
pace , and we just did a lot of different things growing up in here . Uh ,	different	A	A	tn
ave reacted myself in a little different way . I might have done little	different	A	A	tn
all kind of friends . All- all different backgrounds and this this ridi	different	A	A	tn
the seventies ? Uh . It was very different . Like I didn't know what was a	different	A	A	tn
I thought it was kind of like different . Cause it was like in the seve	different	A	A	tn
we would go to , um , schools in different- in a better part of town , but	different	A	A	tn
ot that I recall . No . Well , at different times . Um , in uh , high school ,	different	A	A	tn
und from uh- I mean they go to different countries treating the uh , peo	different	A	A	tn
ing all day long . You're doing different types of things . Um , making re	different	A	A	tn
h , we have about three or four different types of cakes . And three diff	different	A	A	tn
clinical research about these different mental illnesses . Um , and like	different	A	A	tn
take two classes in like these different areas , and I hate- Like I don '	different	A	A	tn
w- I know a lot of stuff about different parts of DC because of my dad .	different	A	A	tn
really impressed with the the different color of race . The long hair .	different	A	A	tn
in a borough . And . Cause we so different down here , we so unique . And b	different	A	A	tn
th a few friends . And that was different because , again , pretty much I '	different	A	A	tn
ll these different places in Rochester , you kind	different	A	A	tn
going there , but . < ts > It was different , but our teachers had like , Ph	different	A	A	tn
ass every night . So that was a different experience . I learned that I c	different	A	A	tn
when are we gonna do something different ? So because of that , I decided	different	A	A	tn
I just felt like the kids were different and it was a lot . They had a b	different	A	A	tn
ng , but still . It's just a lot different . And then when I used to work	different	A	A	tn
ry lenient childhood , but it's different now so I feel like I have to b	different	A	A	tn
year we would have dinner at a different family member's house for Than	different	A	A	tn
p , uh , in Rochester . She has a different experience cause she grew up l	different	A	A	tn
ce . Um , and it opened a lot of different opportunities . Like , um , I've	different	A	A	tn
And so , all- I think all those different moments I started to realize ,	different	A	A	tn
s , and sculpting , and all this different stuff . And I was like , oh this	different	A	A	tn
r , I sat on probably like five different senior committees , really , so	different	A	A	tn
again , like a lot of- a lot of different character , uh , traits . It's li	different	A	A	tn
ook smart , but like , there's a different type of something out here , th	different	A	A	tn
m of my own . So that was three different programs and then there was a	different	A	A	tn
h > And um , she- she's um , very different personality uh , from me but uh	different	A	A	tn
deaf mutes , that's an entirely different aspect of speech correction I	different	A	A	tn
ck . So , I would participate in different community service activities .	different	A	A	tn
a huge difference in a lot of different stuff . Yeah . No . < laugh > Um , s	different	A	A	tn
e things , had I like went to a different school . Um , and so I think jus	different	A	A	tn
I felt like I often had to do different things that I- I know- knew fo	different	A	A	tn
hey do s- c- s- two completely different things . But there was a rivalr	different	A	A	tn
stuff . But now , it's v- a lot different . You kind of know why they're	different	A	A	tn
I feel like the kids are a lot different than when I was younger . Cause	different	A	A	tn
y , you know but it was a quite different relationship because uh , I mak	different	A	A	tn
it varies uh , you know , on the different levels . I don't wanna say cate	different	A	A	tn
so here I was stuck with four different projects , you know . And uh- bu	different	A	A	tn
I started realizing why I was different from other people . Cause like ,	different	A	A	tn
ould just like , get a feel for different environment , different food . S	different	A	A	tn
was like I wanna try grits at different locations until I find the one	different	A	A	tn
for them , like cause they host different stuff on different nights . But	different	A	A	tn
et you get a nice mix of like , different people at all the different ev	different	A	A	tn
who goes to each one is a lot different . Because when I went to the on	different	A	A	tn
h . But now it looks completely different and like , I think the look of	different	A	A	tn
. But it was just- it was just different . I could say like , living in a	different	A	A	tn
ough I have traveled . But it's different living somewhere else than jus	different	A	A	tn
ely different . Every time I go there it's a	different	A	A	tn
building up in every different area , but Northwest is complet	different	A	A	tn
e happened . So the city's just different all over . Now , I guess they're	different	A	A	tn
' re not from it's just like , a different atmosphere . And when I went to	different	A	A	tn
uild up the area so it's a lot different . But then it was just like , ok	different	A	A	tn
t's still Northeast but it's a different atmosphere like when you cross	different	A	A	tn
verybody wants to do something different . But you have to make sure you	different	A	A	tn
X Y and Z ? So like , it's a lot different being on the other side . But i	different	A	A	tn
ust like you look at it from a different point of view . Cause my mother	different	A	A	tn
yourself , but it's just a lot different . Especially dealing with the p	different	A	A	tn
etera . But it just gives you a different outlook on what could happen t	different	A	A	tn
nd , I- I- I try to do a lot of different things for the community cause	different	A	A	tn
ing else . But , what make us so different we can be in- in Alasta- Alask	different	A	A	tn
utside , And don't see all them different um , um , grou- um , race , it's l	different	A	A	tn
egation in education . You have different topics that you can get people	different	A	A	tn
different opinions from different walks of life . And to come tog	different	A	A	tn
it very respectfully . And it's different when you- you have to- you hav	different	A	A	tn
Right . No , I give them a like different view point mostly . Mm-hm . Righ	different	A	A	tn
ng about the same point if not different than you . You have to- you hav	different	A	A	tn
th people differently or watch different things or listen to different	different	A	A	tn
he keeps messing with me . Or , different- different little knick knacks	different	A	A	tn
s or- or go to events . So it's different stuff that the Boys and Girls	different	A	A	tn
thin the community . And you do different like- different like , communit	different	A	A	tn
f somebody was doing something different , I would- I would- I would try	different	A	A	tn
side the box . I would wanna be different , I don't wanna do the same thi	different	A	A	tn
ave Dominican people . You have different- different people from differe	different	A	A	tn
ow the kids learn and all that different stuff . She did that for a whol	different	A	A	tn
struggle and having all these different girls and calling ' em out of t	different	A	A	tn
' t know , people spell it- it's different ways you can spell it . But I w	different	A	A	tn
ou really are just looking for different locations , where's hot . You kn	different	A	A	tn
y ( laughing ) . Typically from a different country . Um , seriously . That's	different	A	A	tn
- I interviewed with like four different people . Um , and the last inter	different	A	A	tn
on't know . It was just a whole different time . Um , and then , after high	different	A	A	tn
inks another way . And like the different topics from- from poverty to r	different	A	A	tn
ng up and stuff . I- I had like different friends . So I'm very a outgoin	different	A	A	tn
came in the city t- for like , different reason like to go see family o	different	A	A	tn
ers < laugh > . Ironside . And the different nights at the movies , < laugh >	different	A	A	tn
s a little different how people act or how people t	different	A	A	tn
So the school system's pretty different in- like in Maryland ? Mm-hm . M	different	A	A	tn
themselves like that feel very different . Um , I felt like I could like ,	different	A	A	tn
I'd- I have always felt like a different learner , and I know this is li	different	A	A	tn
ions now that they play . Is it different ? Like , what is go- like if som	different	A	A	tn
reason . Yeah , it could b- it's different because we have music today an	different	A	A	tn
t it was very cold but it felt different , a different environment . Yeah	different	A	A	tn
racism is like a person like a different color from the , uh , that perso	different	A	A	tn
at The Beacon , it was totally different then , and that was and , dare I	different	A	A	tn
ou have people coming from two different walks of life . And if hopefull	different	A	A	tn
ey left school , it was a whole different- different thing , so . Mm-hm . W	different	A	A	tn
th people with like , you know , different- different abilities , um , in t	different	A	A	tn
. Um , so I bounced around from different majors . Um , I , uh , you know , t	different	A	A	tn

hildren , the mentality is just different . You want better for them . Mm-	different	A	A	tn
tional Stadium area is totally different , you know . And I'm all for cha	different	A	A	tn

, and you're like in a totally different neighborhood . You're like- lik	different	A	A	tn
like , you know , like , lots of different people living . And that was- t	different	A	A	tn
perspective would be a little different . I'd- you know , I think the- t	different	A	A	tn
y turn a corner , and it's very different . Um , < clears throat > so I reme	different	A	A	tn
Right . Yeah . ? It's a- it's a different neighborhood , um , now , than it	different	A	A	tn

ame . So , between those f- four different activities- I mean , you can on	different	A	A	tn
te like ho- you know , like how different their abilities are from mine ,	different	A	A	tn
x happened . Um , like all these different things happened . We were doing	different	A	A	tn

with . Of course I mean it's no different . When you get there , they just	different	A	A	tn
nd this Christmas was a little different from uh , past Christmases . So	different	A	A	tn
is Christmas had been a little different from past Christmases because	different	A	A	tn
as Day we travel around to the different relatives of course , um , durin	different	A	A	tn
ave as- Each person asking a different question < laugh > but uh , I don	different	A	A	tn
each person is doing something different , and uh , if- All day long , I h	different	A	A	tn
So there are probably a lot of different reasons why people- that peopl	different	A	A	tn
he schools . And on a number of different levels . So there was in sports	different	A	A	tn
es . Like , it's I guess this is different from me cause like , I remember	different	A	A	tn
ut , like n- I feel like I knew different things I wanted to do , but the	different	A	A	tn
ething with m- doing something different with my life like something th	different	A	A	tn
hrough the woods . Through like different places where I'm at . Like For	different	A	A	tn
ing each other because of like different opinions . Or how they think . Y	different	A	A	tn
hoodish all day . So , that was different . Um . But , other than that , as	different	A	A	tn
me , just say they don't it was different how I talk . Like , I have a sou	different	A	A	tn
king . And then she had a whole different idea of her existence in our c	different	A	A	tn

with it being mixed . And in a different socio-economi- being surrounde	different	A	A	tn
gh school , so . It was a little different . < laugh > And it was only six o	different	A	A	tn
schools and went to a bunch of different schools- I had been at private	different	A	A	tn

gentrification so it's really different . And it's also hard not- huh ?	different	A	A	tn
Oscars , I just thought it was different and unique in telling a story ,	different	A	A	tn
so it would- it would bring a different dynamic to the school at least	different	A	A	tn
that's fine . Um , < ts > so it's different to go to the ones that were at	different	A	A	tn

ven though I had had a totally different kind of exper- feel like ev- a	different	A	A	tn

hing , you know . It's a- it's a different bracket . I mean , I guess can p	different	A	A	tn
gh > It- it's- it's weird . It's different ways- it's different ways peop	different	A	A	tn
rases , different things that they say , you know	different	A	A	tn
st like down here it's just so different because like , you know , it's-	different	A	A	tn
ve to- to travel to a bunch of different places . And , um , definitely , b	different	A	A	tn
e and all , but cast is a whole different ball game from the Boys and Gi	different	A	A	tn
gave me a opportunity to know different colleges cause I didn't know i	different	A	A	tn
gonna always want some type of different type of strain of weed cause t	different	A	A	tn
hey always want some different type of clothes , you feel me .	different	A	A	tn
you feel that shit cause it be different . That shit disappear . Fucking	different	A	A	tn
it just- it tra- attracts a- a different kind of personality . I think i	different	A	A	tn
they're not . Um , also do like , different grassroots stuff , and help sup	different	A	A	tn
gistration and providing like , different , uh , ways they can collect dat	different	A	A	tn
o see . And , um , it's just very different in Rochester , cause I felt lik	different	A	A	tn
udents , and so , they come from different backgrounds . I actually feel l	different	A	A	tn
e college town , like it was so different , cause like everything was jus	different	A	A	tn
e home , its just , everything's different , I have to G- GPS to get aroun	different	A	A	tn
lize that everything's just so different , um , yeah . Uh , really just lik	different	A	A	tn
ey know it's like a little bit different . So , they're like , uh , I d- ca	different	A	A	tn
. Like , mad , or- or , you know , different things like that . Um , they're	different	A	A	tn
el like the way I talk is very different too . Like , I- I- I was thinkin	different	A	A	tn
m just like going to all these different places cause I'm like , it's co	different	A	A	tn
effort to- to- to make me feel different now , or to expect that I'm dif	different	A	A	tn
t the reasons why I may have a different opinion about something , is be	different	A	A	tn
feeling of these people aren't different . It's just that these people a	different	A	A	tn
eah , you feel me . It's- it's a different- niggas brought a different sw	different	A	A	tn
shit . But when it come from a different state , then niggas want beef w	different	A	A	tn
s like it was a whole bunch of different things , you feel me , and a lot	different	A	A	tn
rder for things to be a little different . Flavor . < laugh > Flavor . You g	different	A	A	tn
and I knew that would bring a different set of challenges in that , I w	different	A	A	tn
compared to < school > , it's so different , right ? Because < school > is so	different	A	A	tn
I think that < school > was very different in the sense that in that town	different	A	A	tn
ke scholarly articles on these different alternative literacies , and yo	different	A	A	tn
p rope . And I did all of these different things with the rope , a single	different	A	A	tn
umped rope and showed a lot of different tricks . Oh yes I was really go	different	A	A	tn
ing , but there are a number of different groups that I do . We play card	different	A	A	tn
you see that like , I made five different classes for me to take . And th	different	A	A	tn
> in Rochester . I went to nine different sites . Like , I had my own site	different	A	A	tn
re , but everything was totally different , you know , trees , the hills , n	different	A	A	tn
re different , but we don't anybody to know	different	A	A	tn
just moving around , people was different , the accents , you know . But , y	different	A	A	tn
Whereas Rochester is just very different . Although , the campus likes to	different	A	A	tn
because grad school is just so different than undergrad . You know , you	different	A	A	tn
' s fine . And so I think , those different things , were just much more pe	different	A	A	tn
then also , like , p- like doing different presentations , or trying to ge	different	A	A	tn
veryday , and just come up with different , like , superficial deadlines a	different	A	A	tn
nd different things that I wanted to do . An	different	A	A	tn
d make different , like , short term and long ter	different	A	A	tn
s and kept me honest about the different goals I had , but it was defini	different	A	A	tn
so I think it's just all these different things at once and I feel like	different	A	A	tn
from Atlanta . It's people from different countries , people from differe	different	A	A	tn
at . And so I think it was very different in a sense that , like , it was	different	A	A	tn
nd , um , it allowed me a lot of different connections that , I mean , I st	different	A	A	tn
n do . That's why everybody got different fans , you feel me . And some ni	different	A	A	tn
en and eighteen , I'm a totally different person . I say me getting tired	different	A	A	tn
hese aren't neighborhood- It's different- N- Neighborhoods within a nei	different	A	A	tn

nd FBR and their kids . It's so different , and i- it depends on the area	different	A	A	tn

their education . < ts > Was very different from me . And it became very cl	different	A	A	tn
kids could be brutal . They had different expectations than I had . They '	different	A	A	tn
at a place like < school > . Very different . I think it's a random kind of	different	A	A	tn
on for Valdosta . I've had very different experiences in all the places	different	A	A	tn
nything . I just picked up like different experiences from it . Like when	different	A	A	tn
meetings , just learning about different forms of energy like coal and	different	A	A	tn
idded- bidded on by just like , different government workers and people	different	A	A	tn
e- they were just getting into different things , trying all different t	different	A	A	tn
I just always like , just be in different neighborhoods . I was never in	different	A	A	tn
nity , but just branched off in different neighborhoods . So growing up ,	different	A	A	tn
re growing up . It was a little different . Parents were parents , kids we	different	A	A	tn
you know , wherever . All those different project people , you would see	different	A	A	tn
. Back in- Back- it's a little different . Yeah . It's changed . It's not	different	A	A	tn

ens , things like that . She had different um , timeshares in resorts that	different	A	A	tn
together , but kind of just in different locations at the same time . Ye	different	A	A	tn
ally different . Like , I mean . I did- First of	different	A	A	tn
ey figured maybe it would be a different thing , and also , I guess if yo	different	A	A	tn
ell now they call it something different I don't know what they call it	different	A	A	tn
I think it's called something different now . But , that's where I went	different	A	A	tn
ddress > I worked a f- in a few different ones , but I ended up on- on th	different	A	A	tn
r that . Um . Oh , it was totally different then . Yeah , it was totally tot	different	A	A	tn
racial relationships . That was different . That- it's not unheard of , bu	different	A	A	tn
Muslim population and v- very different ethnic backgrounds melting tog	different	A	A	tn

particular , that time , it was different . < school > was very new . It was	different	A	A	tn
n that shit . You get something different from it . That's kind of how I	different	A	A	tn

e > , her interests are a little different than , um , < name>'s was when sh	different	A	A	tn
t as a blessing . Yeah , you got different lingos everywhere you go . That	different	A	A	tn
robably would have had a whole different mindset like , damn son like th	different	A	A	tn
n Curry . They would be a total different team without Draymond Green . I	different	A	A	tn
lang- it's the language is different from the standpoint of what we	different	A	A	tn

when it comes to- It might be different interests , but their persisten	different	A	A	tn
hat's the same thing , but just different interests , but the persistence	different	A	A	tn
a- or- or help guide them in a different direction , but they're being p	different	A	A	tn

t's a start . < laugh > It's very diverse , but depending on where you're	diverse	A	A	tn
ting against me . It was pretty diverse I'd say . Like my friend group ,	diverse	A	A	tn
is a very very very diversed- diverse city . You know , d- various nat	diverse	A	A	tn
just based on , like , I have a diverse thing of friends , and , I've ha	diverse	A	A	tn
it's like- I wouldn't call it diverse . We have minorities in powerfu	diverse	A	A	tn
ke- we didn't have , like , that diverse of a , um , program . Like it was	diverse	A	A	tn
Mm-hm . Right . School was very diverse it was nothing but girls . It w	diverse	A	A	tn

e don't think the inner city's diverse , but I went to school with a l	diverse	A	A	tn
rhood was I thinks pretty much diverse at the time , and , um , as I sta	diverse	A	A	tn
ing able like to go out and be diverse and see other things , you know	diverse	A	A	tn
ips and interactions were very diverse . So , like I said , it wasn't- w	diverse	A	A	tn
getting funding if they had a diverse faculty . So our good professor	diverse	A	A	tn
I went to like , another like , diverse , free school , you understand ?	diverse	A	A	tn

ut the- the- the violence now , especially here in the last few months , w	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
ut , I find that my experience , especially as a student of color was diff	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
, that was the main thing . And especially like- like her favorite dish w	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
, of course , you know , ? like , especially like growing up it used to get	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
nority in a white environment , especially by the time I was in high scho	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
am in it uh , children you know especially , when they wasn't doing no wor	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
out three or four o'clock , and especially when we were little . I remembe	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
cting with family . And I think especially- Yeah . Especially because my r	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
nd . But every once in a while , especially Twilight Zone , had some pretty	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
ke people- It's so funny like , especially like in the black community ca	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
So many different reasons . And especially now , it's like- And this is ho	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
We- Okay this was like maybe- especially like in the summer time so , ou	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
pective of when I grew up , as- especially in elementary school , my day c	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
take my mom back to the house , especially since the weather's been reall	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
way anymore at all . And that's especially U Street , um , H Street , um , he	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
xpect , but I get that more so , especially from people who live and are f	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
in , you call . You know . Or um , especially when she went away to college	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
ort of economically flat . And , especially- and the city's struggling wit	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
s a l- a great more diversity , especially on the westside , because you h	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
itting there you know looking- especially the little boys you know they	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
anytime . Ceiling fall on you , especially the old houses . unintelligible	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
energized this whole city . Um , especially with young people that who wer	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
a few cats , several cats . Um , especially out in Maryland . We had a rabb	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
n . The city has changed . Like , especially physically . Like , it's so many	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
es to better themselves . Like , especially after they got a record , it's	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
s . So , um , it was almost like- especially during the summer , during the	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
I love dancing to black music , especially music that I like grew up on .	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
ngs different kids don't . Like especially in Middle Eastern parts of the	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
is a diabetic . And they wanted especially get those first , the ones that	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
t's so secluded , it's a shock , especially as a young child , or not even	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
re several others that come on especially Saturday morning , and I usuall	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
big- it's a big culture shock especially when you- when you were born a	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
pending on who I'm around . Um , especially since I'm like I'm black and s	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
came home on the weekends . Um . Especially when I stopped playing basketb	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
unique hybrid in PG County um , especially with the gentrification that s	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
verything else in New Orleans , especially the up and the down- downtown	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
toll- it's showing itself now . Especially with the uh , I was reading the	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
into doing certain things . And especially young ladies try to con me , mo	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
red . You know what I'm saying , especially my father , my father really wa	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
, I can pretty much guess wha- especially down here , I can pretty much g	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
know the the one to be teased , especially for how I talk , so I used that	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
ee this I just wanna make sure especially since I was talking about my p	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
you feel real good . Yup . Then especially when I had one that come up to	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
s um , football and basketball , especially basketball . Um , I still really	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
so I think that- so it became , especially on the northern part of the Lo	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
spend three years with someone especially at that age and they really wo	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
. I loved going there and the- especially the education , the way that th	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
uff . They're building that up . Especially since the stadium is out there	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
se you have to have that vibe , especially at school . Cause kids are very	especially	R	POSTVB	tp
eighborhood , it felt like home essentially because even in like , here , DC	essentially	R	POSTVB	tp
t the boy's club and then they essentially gave me a summer job . ( laughin	essentially	R	PREVB	tp
trip without any older people essentially . It was just like , me and my b	essentially	R	POSTVB	tp
t no kids for him to play with essentially . And so in order for him to ha	essentially	R	POSTVB	tp
I wanted to engage . And it was essentially the same size as our high scho	essentially	R	POSTVB	tp
a part of the party scene . And essentially went to jail , and you know . So	essentially	R	PREVB	tp
didn't live in a neighborhood essentially , but as I got older , I started	essentially	R	POSTVB	tp

t were both under-enrolled and essentially segregated . So my- while I was	essentially	R	PREJJ	tp
rsify . And , so , they were , um , essentially recruiting , for lack of a bett	essentially	R	PREVB	tp
that came into play . And , um , essentially find my biological father , and	essentially	R	PREVB	tp
nabas said he'll never die , be eternal life . But he sleeps in- he sle	eternal	A	A	tn
er , there were other different ethnic groups . Those ethnic groups , t	ethnic	A	A	tn

unt of that incident . And then eventually I come back , see , the next uh ,	eventually	R	PREVB	tp
into it . Um , but I guess they eventually worked it out cause my mother	eventually	R	PREVB	tp
where I could see it , see ? But eventually I had to give it up , which I s	eventually	R	PREVB	tp
- took it up in uh- then uh- I eventually got it- gave it up because it-	eventually	R	PREVB	tp

p with , just like getting more financial education out there , getting p	financial	A	A	tn
- you know , like , they changed financial aid . You used to be able to bo	financial	A	A	tn
DC charter schools now to get financial education into schools . < ts > I	financial	A	A	tn

rson to handle all my parent's financial stuff . So , didn't go through a	financial	A	A	tn
he town was really really in a financial bind and uh , in my opinion it	financial	A	A	tn
lf . Like when it came to what , financial aid that you gotta do for scho	financial	A	A	tn
I was also getting some other financial assistance but then Georgetown	financial	A	A	tn
or school and maintaining your financial services than you do in school	financial	A	A	tn

y to do better in terms of the financial strain that my family was cons	financial	A	A	tn
the management o- owner and a financial institution got together creat	financial	A	A	tn
n't um- they didn't approve my financial aid . So I had to drop out . So	financial	A	A	tn
tuition cause I didn't get any financial aid . I didn't qualify for EOP .	financial	A	A	tn
e- and these- and that's where financial literacy and all that stuff co	financial	A	A	tn
, both emotionally and um < ts > financially . Mkay . Um , I had um , really go	financially	R	POSTVB	tp
you- you had a point where you financially stable , as you- as you move ou	financially	R	PREJJ	tp
where- And it's not even just financially it's just anything like , she's	financially	R	POSTVB	tp

ld say probably educationally , financially- the structures , it was family	financially	R	POSTVB	tp
ith or content with . You know , financially and uh , socially well , you hav	financially	R	POSTVB	tp
stuff . So I'm getting settled financially . I know . That's crazy . Um- < la	financially	R	POSTVB	tp
came like- It's just- I'm more financially independent in a sense , but as	financially	R	PREJJ	tp
lower middle class . Uh , f- Uh , financially speaking , lower middle class .	financially	R	PREVB	tp
se they had the f- the ability financially to do that . Whereas when we we	financially	R	POSTVB	tp

I do to , you know , assist her , financially . You know . So , I guess that th	financially	R	POSTVB	tp
from < name > . And so we weren't financially ready to < ts > renovate the hou	financially	R	PREJJ	tp

I'm either wi- either with my immediate family or the brothers and sis	immediate	A	A	tn

rest of what was going on at- immediately . Certainly when everything die	immediately	R	POSTVB	tp
me . Well uh , without sounding immodest , uh- I am very understanding ,	immodest	A	A	tn
where the teacher could become impatient with a child , you see . He's wo	impatient	A	A	tn
es as a businessman is fucking impeccable . Thirdly , his fucking music ca	impeccable	A	A	tn
nce , but I definitely had more implicit kind of , uh , racially , o- um ,	implicit	A	A	tn
nce of discrimination , whether implicit or k- e- explicit in terms of	implicit	A	A	tn
, like , I feel like sometimes , implicitly , or explicitly people want you	implicitly	R	PREVB	tp
was impolite for accu- for accusing me of t	impolite	A	A	tn
who it was . So she told me how impolite I was , and I told her that she	impolite	A	A	tn
saying ? Talking about it , how important . You know , even in our churche	important	A	A	tn
tening- active listening is so important because listening is not just	important	A	A	tn
ve in the same place . That was important for me to have that connection	important	A	A	tn
m and dad was there . Yes . It's important to have somebody in your corne	important	A	A	tn
stions , like I understand it's important . It's your dissertation it's i	important	A	A	tn
far as I'm concerned the- the important things- they're there for the	important	A	A	tn
' s like looking good is really important to him but like my mom couldn '	important	A	A	tn
ime , it- yeah , fuck it , it was important that I be out of my environmen	important	A	A	tn
hat um- And just education was important to her . Like , I- My fondest me	important	A	A	tn
paid ? I want to learn . This is important . But people really- I got intr	important	A	A	tn
w what I'm saying , is- is more important . Because , you know , I still ha	important	A	A	tn
he same . And I think that it's important as women that , you know , we ca	important	A	A	tn
ndraise for us . So it's a very important job , it's highly stressful . Um	important	A	A	tn
dren because what I do is very important in terms of , um , grants that w	important	A	A	tn
out for him . And that- that's important to me . And- Yeah , and even my	important	A	A	tn
and education was a very very important thing to all of the families a	important	A	A	tn
materialistic things , weren't important . They never took us to go see	important	A	A	tn
family , education was import- important , but those structural things ,	important	A	A	tn
can we do ? That's why it's so important for us to vote . It's very impo	important	A	A	tn
e . You know , and and it's very important . Um in in other words , that me	important	A	A	tn
e and this would become um , an important route in the Underground Railr	important	A	A	tn
at . And so the most like- most important thing that I can remember abou	important	A	A	tn
they got theirs . That was more important , so . So . Yeah . Oh yeah , yeah .	important	A	A	tn
went on there . So , that was an important part of us- our thing right ? T	important	A	A	tn
eward Park High School i- is important you know . I think as an instit	important	A	A	tn
the Lower East Side are really important to me . You kn- you know . Um . S	important	A	A	tn
town so communication is very important . Let people know where you are	important	A	A	tn
e- it operated , and why it was important to pay your bill and this and	important	A	A	tn
gs going . That to me is really important you know . Um . Because they wer	important	A	A	tn
it cause I don't think that's important . But it- Nah , nah , nah . From ?	important	A	A	tn
s important to me . I was not a teacher . I	important	A	A	tn
( laughing ) < laugh > This is not important to me . ( laughing ) Oh , well it '	important	A	A	tn
d so they- they've become very important the- the uh n- the incredible	important	A	A	tn
um , an account executive on an important account at a major advertising	important	A	A	tn
the Lower East Side that were important to me are gone . y- you know , l	important	A	A	tn
vividly , you know , that was an important part of my life . And- because	important	A	A	tn
ose kinds of memories . So it's important but gotta find it , you know . (	important	A	A	tn
your education was like , very important . Like Cs to her was a F , used	important	A	A	tn
um , since your father's a very important man , you should know how to do	important	A	A	tn
ng . And her father's a v- very important man , so the teacher- So she go	important	A	A	tn
nd getting a good job are more important than partying cause you can pa	important	A	A	tn
s you can do and they show you important people like I met a lot of dem	important	A	A	tn
veral stories that were really important to me in my life . You know . Bu	important	A	A	tn
n't wanna do it , but it was so important to her . I mean she would iron	important	A	A	tn
been there before me . That was important . There was always this kind of	important	A	A	tn
cally successful , cause that's important . Wanting to do band too , it wa	important	A	A	tn
ng a marching cat was actually important , it it was not a scarlet lette	important	A	A	tn
, you could be doing something important owing something you can be any	important	A	A	tn
be all that they came to be is important . And you don't get to be- you	important	A	A	tn
Yup . Mm-hm . Neighborhoods are important . Right . Right . Cause that's va	important	A	A	tn
would attribute it why that's important , why that's sort of unique her	important	A	A	tn
ll us that the school was more important . So that's- that's what we did	important	A	A	tn
selling drugs ? Is that really important ? How is that gonna make me som	important	A	A	tn
s and how they operate , what's important to them , what's priorities , it	important	A	A	tn
a big issue here , I think it's important to be able to , you know , to ta	important	A	A	tn
ges and just things and names , important names and things that happened	important	A	A	tn
nspired me to look at what was important . And Charlotte's a great city .	important	A	A	tn
t because granny was such , um , important part of not just my life , but	important	A	A	tn
that out ? Yeah . That's a very important part . And , that's what we did	important	A	A	tn
s . How important it is . You don't throw away yo	important	A	A	tn
that . But that whole area was important for a number of reasons . One ,	important	A	A	tn
re . And there's something very important about that sculpture , but I do	important	A	A	tn
These are lessons that were so important that . And you can't do this wi	important	A	A	tn
illing each other . Why is that important ? It's important because when t	important	A	A	tn
mean ? With your family . That's important . Yeah , yeah . Cause now it's so	important	A	A	tn
ligible I feel you there . It's important to come together , you know wha	important	A	A	tn
the top . Why do you think it's important- that's important ? Like why do	important	A	A	tn
know , so- So those are really important things that you have to consid	important	A	A	tn
east . And- and so , it was very important for me to get involved with bl	important	A	A	tn
nd then I realized that it was important to me to come back to Princevi	important	A	A	tn
, or- < laugh > So , I think it's important to create the spaces , and then	important	A	A	tn
that was a good thing . It was important . You know , so . Yeah . No . I don	important	A	A	tn
me a look , and it was- it was important that I checked in with him . An	important	A	A	tn
t anybody else's money is less important . You know , cause people are ma	important	A	A	tn
. < laugh > Then the- the ? most important thing probably is seeing how w	important	A	A	tn
endance is taking , um notices- important notices are read um class busi	important	A	A	tn
serious stuff . Driving is very important . You know ? Okay .	important	A	A	tn
- a lot of money has become an important thing to me , and I- I guess I '	important	A	A	tn
e . I think being happy is most important now . Whatever that is . Whateve	important	A	A	tn
at way but it is . It's just as important as going and punching in somew	important	A	A	tn
ouglass , you know , lived a- an important part of their lives here . Um ,	important	A	A	tn
bers . I think it's super super important . I wish I had more , uh , p- fa-	important	A	A	tn
was coming up . That's the most important thing , but I never did go far	important	A	A	tn
id , what- they let me know how important it was to get a education . Um ,	important	A	A	tn
anna be treated . That's always important to me . That's something I've i	important	A	A	tn
others . I think respect is so important because you can get so much fa	important	A	A	tn
n , growing up . That was really important to him . Um , so now- Do I have	important	A	A	tn
t I had made . So that was very important to me . So I um , stopped going	important	A	A	tn
ive her . And that was the most important thing to me because she didn't	important	A	A	tn
that's why that the museum is important , you know . If the p- if parent	important	A	A	tn
pport . But my independence was important to me . So I was not gonna go b	important	A	A	tn
things , you know . All sorts of important things . No he's not . He's a th	important	A	A	tn
e now you feel , uh , whatever ? important , singled out , like , you know w	important	A	A	tn
an't have a person who is that important that people will just follow .	important	A	A	tn
age as far as what I think is important in life in general . It's just	important	A	A	tn
at I mean . Yeah , the DJ always important , and the producer though cause	important	A	A	tn
hter all the time about what's important , I mean , what's gonna be there	important	A	A	tn
hat I think he did was nothing important , uh , um , that they would c- co	important	A	A	tn
standpoint of what we consider important . Manners , saying thank you for	important	A	A	tn
people have been through . Very important . Mm-hm . No . But I lived here f	important	A	A	tn
id person with valid ideas and important ideas . I don't know , seems as	important	A	A	tn
I don't feel like he's no more important than I am . Don't make him bett	important	A	A	tn
d it at that time . It was very important to me at the time , but I don't	important	A	A	tn
. I think discipline is a very important part of a classroom . Now , when	important	A	A	tn
eation center , that was really important to my development . So I spent	important	A	A	tn
like , it's- it's so much more important than people seem to think . And	important	A	A	tn
m . You right . You right . It is important . Cause that's a job . Well Pine	important	A	A	tn
gree that i- it becomes almost impossible to address . And so what we hav	impossible	A	A	tn
never do it the same way . It's impossible . the pieces don't fit anymore ,	impossible	A	A	tn
l it's fiction because um it's impossible for some people to do some of	impossible	A	A	tn
s you can't say nothing that's impossible . < laugh > You know ? Then one of	impossible	A	A	tn
ys . But some people think it's impossible because someone's skin is diff	impossible	A	A	tn
the one that's straight- it's impossible for it to stay straight becaus	impossible	A	A	tn
le to keep track of time ? It's impossible because there's no way- this i	impossible	A	A	tn
days it was , you know , almost impossible for a colored man to marry a w	impossible	A	A	tn
know , I really feel that it's impossible because I know for myself if s	impossible	A	A	tn
that um , that was the most uh , impressive thing . Uh , the thing that I wa	impressive	A	A	tn
om that long ago , it's kind of impressive . Other than the history and th	impressive	A	A	tn
e way I spoke to him was like , improper or something . And I couldn't r	improper	A	A	tn

But the moment somebody feels inadequate , that's when all hell breaks l	inadequate	A	A	tn

look at it as uh- It's- It's a learned skilled dance um , that you can	learned	A	A	tn
t to < school > . Mm . I am a lead legal assistant for < work > . < work > .	legal	A	A	tn
ey were arrested before it was legal . So the fact that they're serv	legal	A	A	tn
ve to ten for something that's legal now , I just don't- I can't sta	legal	A	A	tn
the world that still has , uh , legal slavery . And they went through	legal	A	A	tn
all the other divorces was- is legal , so . But actually wasn't never	legal	A	A	tn

, completely legal in DC ? Yeah , and it's people-	legal	A	A	tn
ijuana gr- even though it is a legal thing now . Granted you can onl	legal	A	A	tn

ed the legal- I can't remember what it was .	legal	A	A	tn
uler . I don't know if that was legal or not , but . Hey , we were six ,	legal	A	A	tn
so for insurance purposes and legal purposes , my grandparents had	legal	A	A	tn
, and got this um a job with a legal firm . And she got involved emo	legal	A	A	tn

ower East Side I f- maintain a legal residence , put it that way . Fo	legal	A	A	tn
as one course keeping from the legal certificate . But- and then , I	legal	A	A	tn
much but you can . Because it's legal . < clears throat > And , um , yeah	legal	A	A	tn
tory . And then , I went for the legal certificate , and , one , there w	legal	A	A	tn
um one of the partners of the legal firm , and they had a se t-t o he	legal	A	A	tn
little hunting . And you could legally carry your gun in your car . An	legally	R	PREVB	tp

ee . I- It's a job . It's , uh , a legitimate job . Too bad people don't see	legitimate	A	A	tn
Side . In- in the hood . It was legitimately that . I hate people say it's t	legitimately	R	POSTVB	tp

press their neighbors with how liberal they really are . You know , twe	liberal	A	A	tn
chool- our school is extremely liberal . The people at our school , uh-	liberal	A	A	tn

hings start to happen Um , more local control . More- more f- more fo	local	A	A	tn
hools are there . They have the local parks , they can walk to the lo	local	A	A	tn
ferent phones that you use for local board , they have to be issued .	local	A	A	tn
Um , I- Just s- seeing the- the local delis and everybody , you know ,	local	A	A	tn

But really like , pouring into local artists like , they got all the	local	A	A	tn
so , I'm pr- very proud of the local activism that I'm seeing . Roch	local	A	A	tn
e board of education's office , local schools . Did a little bit of e	local	A	A	tn
to mail it out to the various local board . Uh- Uh- Well , pencils ,	local	A	A	tn
, I issue supplies for all the local board . After- After I issue su	local	A	A	tn
was penny candy stores and the local grocery store . Everybody had a	local	A	A	tn
. Um , I still believe in using local parks because I understand the	local	A	A	tn
int nine , they are all playing local talent now . You know , and that	local	A	A	tn
was like only two or three s- local stations . You didn't have , you	local	A	A	tn
ming from maybe uh , one of the local neighborhood uh , skateboard sp	local	A	A	tn
you know the I think that the local residents ought to have some p	local	A	A	tn
that just , um , started . It's a local , so it's a low frequency radio	local	A	A	tn
really heavily into politics , local politics , um , in the county an	local	A	A	tn
t a little bit more . Okay , now local acts are being heard by the pe	local	A	A	tn
relate to . And it's like , they local celebrities . Like they- they s	local	A	A	tn
, uh , to- to just give you the local , uh , uh , reality about Rochest	local	A	A	tn
he county exec , and a few , uh , local business people along with a l	local	A	A	tn
leave home , and we had a a- a local institution that was on the- o	local	A	A	tn
ack to school I was doing like local schools . And I considered ECU	local	A	A	tn
d and refocus . Meeting with my local senators and congress people a	local	A	A	tn
ls me that the handling of- of local politics has has gotten very d	local	A	A	tn
, becomes the headline for the local news on a regular basis . Two ,	local	A	A	tn
d been working part time for a local ambulance company , and when I	local	A	A	tn

those same people to come to a local event , you know , and support t	local	A	A	tn
had to go closer to like your local area or something they did tha	local	A	A	tn

- You know , this like what our main truck right here . Get all the	main	A	A	tn
les in my life . Um , one of the main things was bad relationships .	main	A	A	tn
day , uh , so like they were two main events that were why my parent	main	A	A	tn
o stay home because we was the main ones that have to run the farm	main	A	A	tn
ll hands back then . That's the main term they used . To go out into	main	A	A	tn
ay with a lot of things , so my main- main thing was staying out . M	main	A	A	tn
as is from go go , that was the main outlet for the kids , go go . An	main	A	A	tn
know , I have WAYO as like the main radio station , my go-to when I	main	A	A	tn
rimarily- I was closest to- My main friend was a girl across the s	main	A	A	tn
m team I feel like was like my main activity that point , I was ter	main	A	A	tn
I really liked the teacher- my main teacher that I had . And , um , y	main	A	A	tn
d of played himself , the other main guy in it , he's from Colu- he '	main	A	A	tn
n class and < school > - < school > main thing is like , okay ( whispered	main	A	A	tn
mber . And so , you know , my- my main focus is this community- is- i	main	A	A	tn
, stuff like- but not like the main monuments . We went to the , um ,	main	A	A	tn
me um , the school had only the main entrance where you go in to th	main	A	A	tn
call Uncle Tommy . And uh , the main thing I remember about this li	main	A	A	tn
-hm . < ts > Well uh , I think the main thing um , I'd get my father to	main	A	A	tn

elf doing that . Um , but my- my main focus and now , you know , < name	main	A	A	tn
. And also , um , I think my- my main focus for next year is for me	main	A	A	tn
h . That's the re- that was the main reason we decided to leave bec	main	A	A	tn
hat's really- that's really my main goal , but I was just thought t	main	A	A	tn
two two nine . I just knew the main area codes , but two two nine k	main	A	A	tn
d I used to go ? Those were the main places I went . The library ? No	main	A	A	tn
and I don't know , I think the main thing though is wait- everyone	main	A	A	tn
e had AM radio . There were two main ch- uh , stations that we liste	main	A	A	tn
t wasn't as bad as some of the main streets . In regards to the thr	main	A	A	tn
s together as a family . But my main focus is really on children be	main	A	A	tn
I live- < school > was , um , the main campus is in Garden City , New	main	A	A	tn
ng and , you know , that was the main thing . And especially like- li	main	A	A	tn
lright . But basketball was the main sport I played . A lot of it . I	main	A	A	tn
restler too . And wrestling his main thing . And , he had something h	main	A	A	tn
lumbing . That's it . That's the main thing I like doing . Plumbing .	main	A	A	tn
about I know that- that's the main thing I learned was the electr	main	A	A	tn
. But , um , yeah , those were my main courses . Oh , 4-H ? Yeah . The 4-	main	A	A	tn

of them niggas , man . Like the main ones like on my mom's side . It	main	A	A	tn
f go go music ? Like what's the main instrument- like , For me- for	main	A	A	tn
something else but I think the main thing would be , after getting	main	A	A	tn
nce in awhile . But I think the main thing is that she has to get a	main	A	A	tn
- It seems that right now , the main thing is for the step daughter	main	A	A	tn
st area , uh , < address > was the main street . Um , to this day my gra	main	A	A	tn
et a B . So that was one of the main things that I took away from t	main	A	A	tn
as other shit . I- that was the main thing . I was just- I just n- I	main	A	A	tn
hat's where we have one of the main TVs and the other main TV is i	main	A	A	tn
various phases . The m- ma- the main point of the game is to put th	main	A	A	tn
ther sticky stinky sofa in the main office . And this one of them s	main	A	A	tn
tired of that . But one of the main reasons was I just wasn't too	main	A	A	tn
' em , and I think that was the main thing . That , and maybe he coul	main	A	A	tn
ship , happiness . And those the main things a man need in this worl	main	A	A	tn
in there , cause those was the main things I was interested in . An	main	A	A	tn
amily of five . Uh , you got the main floor then you got the basemen	main	A	A	tn
hip for Penn State , University main campus . So I wanted her to hav	main	A	A	tn
lly remember the holidays . The main holidays . Wh- when we could af	main	A	A	tn
s a actress and the supposedly main character of a TV serial and s	main	A	A	tn
n . Um the plot was uh that the main character I forget her name or	main	A	A	tn
hrough Dover . Cause that's the main mortuary for the entire milita	main	A	A	tn
street that , uh , was the same main street I was on- that I grew u	main	A	A	tn
when I was in high school , the main- the biggest thing was- I thin	main	A	A	tn
r time . Um . I think that's the main part about it . Like , what happ	main	A	A	tn
about almost anything . If- The main thing , if two boys- Say you an	main	A	A	tn
remember . And it was also , the main thing was what was um , kind of	main	A	A	tn
hat I had to go up to the , um , main building , which was on < addres	main	A	A	tn
ame > , that was , uh , one of the main directors . Um , of the choir . A	main	A	A	tn
sh me . You know , I- That's the main thing . I used to get a lot of	main	A	A	tn
streets . I think that was the main thing . Want to , try to keep ou	main	A	A	tn
it is , yeah . Yeah . There's the main building . It was in < address > .	main	A	A	tn
nt . He was flooded . Um , but my main concern was my mom was handica	main	A	A	tn

o make fast money . That was my main object , you know . The easy way	main	A	A	tn
And so uh this is- this is the main thing right now , getting into	main	A	A	tn
I mean , um , yeah . I mean , the main thing for me was like always h	main	A	A	tn
ught that we were still on the main road to get to wherever we wer	main	A	A	tn

was always negative . Always negative . < ts > But Princeville , I like	negative	A	A	tn
a car , put two wires to it the negative and the positive and see it sp	negative	A	A	tn

Those were like , the only two negative experiences that I had here , s	negative	A	A	tn
n't really into doing anything negative . We would have uh , rock fights	negative	A	A	tn

their children adopt a really negative attitude toward their peers wh	negative	A	A	tn
d is fun when you young . Being negative is fun when you young . Cause e	negative	A	A	tn
I said , it was always so much negative things now people seeing like	negative	A	A	tn
we're always attached to such negative things , like , it's like rare y	negative	A	A	tn
it's- it's attached to so much negative things . Like people done got k	negative	A	A	tn
was positive instead of being negative . I don't- I don't know how to	negative	A	A	tn
sitive towards you for ha- for negative . Mm-hm . Uh , somewhat . My mom w	negative	A	A	tn
always entertain positive . The negative , you know it's negative , don't	negative	A	A	tn

ause it's like DC now has this negative thing now s- that's the only t	negative	A	A	tn
, none of the outsiders or the negative energy distract me from gettin	negative	A	A	tn
ve about it . We always heard a negative- Exactly- No . No . Negative . It	negative	A	A	tn
ow , just you just think of the negative things about hog . You know ( la	negative	A	A	tn
everything that you do that's negative . Worse . I think it's getting w	negative	A	A	tn
-uh , no . I feel , I have a very negative view of her , cause I feel , lik	negative	A	A	tn

eally think that that's- those negative things are spill- they've- the	negative	A	A	tn
d it , that's what I see is the negative stuff . Um , and I hated it . I w	negative	A	A	tn
y talk about white people in a negative way , so you d- adapt that . But	negative	A	A	tn
ng I heard about Southeast was negative . So one day we drove over ther	negative	A	A	tn
succeeding . All you heard was negative things . You know , I went to th	negative	A	A	tn
w nothing about them , all , the negative perceptions that would l- fall	negative	A	A	tn
the time . And so when < name > a negative strike against the town I can	negative	A	A	tn
positive things reported than negative things about Princeville . Caus	negative	A	A	tn
more positive things than the negative . You know , so that's why I say	negative	A	A	tn
reason . So , if it's something negative down here , if or like , I ain't	negative	A	A	tn
s used . And there was way more negative energy used to- to- to hate hi	negative	A	A	tn
titude toward the children was negative completely . You would think th	negative	A	A	tn

ody's negative , other half is positive . But ,	negative	A	A	tn

that's- that's just my- it's a new form of genocide . They ain't t	new	A	A	tn
ame up in that era , uh , it's a new form of genocide now whereas ,	new	A	A	tn
here so drugs- drugs is not a new thing . But people- people are	new	A	A	tn
definitely was a new vibe . Uh , we had a- we had a i	new	A	A	tn
of the town employees um , are new from his administration though	new	A	A	tn
m-hm . Well , we were uh , fairly new to the area , and uh , fact , eve	new	A	A	tn
rybody was new to the area . It was formed in	new	A	A	tn
h , and uh , there were a lot of new girls that came to the school .	new	A	A	tn

against it , but um , uh , I met new friends there but it's not- it	new	A	A	tn
t it was filled instantly with new people . You know so obviously	new	A	A	tn
cause so everything is just so new . And some of the businesses th	new	A	A	tn
o they started something brand new . Um , I would definitely say th	new	A	A	tn
new settlement . Like a new development . ?? the new apartm	new	A	A	tn
n you look around , look like a new town . You know , so you ain't l	new	A	A	tn
igh School . Um , it was a brand new facility . I would say , um , it	new	A	A	tn
t's been flooded , it's nothing new except for I think there was-	new	A	A	tn
ow ? But um , they- it's nothing new to see them with water up this	new	A	A	tn
monkey bars and um , just meet new friends . That's- play in the s	new	A	A	tn
time where you got to uh , see new people and- and different peop	new	A	A	tn
ost if there's like- uh , like , new words , but I definitely feel l	new	A	A	tn
ound that out , I got all these new friends , you know . ( laughing )	new	A	A	tn
es in that , I would be in this new place , where I didn't know any	new	A	A	tn

I came back it was relatively new . I picked that up . And the Sop	new	A	A	tn
Uh , mostly just , uh , couple of new ones out that I don't know abo	new	A	A	tn

a- one of those dog coats and new dishes and things like that . A	new	A	A	tn
y resume could go and get me a new job , but like realistically , t	new	A	A	tn

considered the worst . And then obviously like , the suburbs and Pittsfor	obviously	R	PREVB	tp

vorite subject , um , but I love political science . It's what I majored i	political	A	A	tn
ked in a lot of ?? politician , political stuff , so , stuff like that . Um	political	A	A	tn
So , I remember coming in . So , political science a- actually a very qua	political	A	A	tn
I was like , okay I'll just do political science , and okay , I'll do it	political	A	A	tn
I would be that interested in political science . And so when I did < sc	political	A	A	tn
DC , the nation's capital , the political center of- of the- of the worl	political	A	A	tn

s it's- it's- it's us having a political voice number one , which we don	political	A	A	tn
other courses so I was taking political science , but it was just kind	political	A	A	tn
black female friend who was in political science that I think helped- w	political	A	A	tn
o I majored in mathematics and political science . So , you v- political	political	A	A	tn
it was really unfortunate . And political science to some extent was lik	political	A	A	tn
uh Black Panthers a lot , very political activists , and um I mean , I'm	political	A	A	tn
who do you- he said who's your political party ? We got to talking about	political	A	A	tn
nd I was kind of always really political myself . I was a little pro-bla	political	A	A	tn
orfolk State . I wanna major in political science with a minor in psycho	political	A	A	tn

' t really know . But , with this political power I could express these id	political	A	A	tn
t's going on . And I don't know political power would enable me to get d	political	A	A	tn
ollowers or whatever . If I had political power , I would look into deepl	political	A	A	tn
< ts > uh , of resources , um , uh , political , uh , isolation . I mean , we hav	political	A	A	tn
ith my father due to like some political situations as far as the stree	political	A	A	tn

w that Adams Morgan was really popular for different go go bands . And	popular	A	A	tn
hm . Yeah . They're- They're not popular . Even though people know , um ,	popular	A	A	tn
black communities . That's been popular for decades . They kind of like	popular	A	A	tn
nd stuff is popular . It's gonna get me a scholarsh	popular	A	A	tn
of his , uh , policies were not popular with the , uh , administration a	popular	A	A	tn
And I had that , and I was very popular growing up . So I'm just , you k	popular	A	A	tn
o sauce , yeah . Mumbo sauce uh , popular in the- back in the sixties to	popular	A	A	tn
t > the reason why go go was so popular growing up because it was our	popular	A	A	tn

alley here . So go go music was popular actually when I was away in co	popular	A	A	tn
man's name now . But he's real popular and he's worldwide . Mm-hm . Yea	popular	A	A	tn
ess . And um , they weren't very popular at school . People would um , pi	popular	A	A	tn
o soul food . They're very very popular , um , in the area as well . Kind	popular	A	A	tn

d on this thing cause it's the popular- the football and the sports a	popular	A	A	tn
in a gang , cause one , when you popular , and you know half the world ,	popular	A	A	tn
ok and- and this , that- and be popular . So I said when- when I had my	popular	A	A	tn
go to school cause like I was popular like everybody liked me and st	popular	A	A	tn
talk about the struggle to be popular . If that's not your reality , t	popular	A	A	tn
t go- go go , which is like the popular go go that they listen to now .	popular	A	A	tn
ng a reading problem and being popular , in the late seventies , early	popular	A	A	tn

thing . Go go , R&B , whatever is popular , you know , I try to find out w	popular	A	A	tn
school , even though I was not popular . At all ( laughing ) . I was so-	popular	A	A	tn
And so , I was u- I was really popular , and I would have th- little p	popular	A	A	tn

o . What's the- what's the most popular instrument of- And- of go go m	popular	A	A	tn
l like- I was definitely not a popular kid , but I wasn't a not popula	popular	A	A	tn
in the world , and I was really popular , but here , I've just had a har	popular	A	A	tn
red it out and I became pretty popular I guess and had a lot of frien	popular	A	A	tn
like a- I'm still like , not a popular girl . I'm still who I was in h	popular	A	A	tn
o people too much to think I'm popular , I just talk to people and do	popular	A	A	tn
course , I showed up , cause I'm popular , I always had money , dressed g	popular	A	A	tn
and in hand . And I chose to be popular over knowledge . And by me choo	popular	A	A	tn
just wish all the schools was positive instead of being negative . I d	positive	A	A	tn
' s hard , like , it's hard to be positive . It's hard to stay on- I guess	positive	A	A	tn
ly a culture shock , but mostly positive , you know what I'm saying . So	positive	A	A	tn
n get out . That's what keep me positive and < name > won't let me . Like ,	positive	A	A	tn
st like , for me I say that's a positive thing . I say that's a positive	positive	A	A	tn
the South somewhere . Not- not positive . I think it was North Carolina	positive	A	A	tn
ortunities just by- just being positive and going into school and just	positive	A	A	tn
people that have done so many positive things for their lives , and ma	positive	A	A	tn
she came along there was some positive things that started to happen .	positive	A	A	tn
s exposed to a lot of the more positive things than the negative . You	positive	A	A	tn
nd it just turned to be like a positive thing . And he took her out of	positive	A	A	tn
very blessed to have a lot of positive educated black women . I worked	positive	A	A	tn
I- I surrounded myself around positive people , positive women who wer	positive	A	A	tn
f you can see- Look at all the positive things that came out of that ,	positive	A	A	tn
h , just with comedy and just a positive vibe all the time . Like , whene	positive	A	A	tn
ping ' em involved in something positive so they wouldn't be a product	positive	A	A	tn
n . But in everything you do be positive with it and have a attitude wh	positive	A	A	tn
gative energy is out , it's all positive vibes after that . I feel like	positive	A	A	tn
rare you hear DC as something positive beside the President , it's jus	positive	A	A	tn
gnant with < name > . But I'm not positive . Um , so she had all four of us	positive	A	A	tn
active member . I met a lot of positive people um , on just like , the m	positive	A	A	tn
computer and just being around positive people . And then after awhile ,	positive	A	A	tn
through my mind . I was always positive um , always humble growing up .	positive	A	A	tn
y- < laugh > for really having a positive impact , and a lot- all of them	positive	A	A	tn
the one experience that was so positive out of my entire experience at	positive	A	A	tn
keep the positive vibes < exhale > Boy what . < ts >	positive	A	A	tn
it wasn't nothing too- nothing positive about it . We always heard a ne	positive	A	A	tn
ur outlets . And the head being positive . So when you- that's like a ba	positive	A	A	tn
ational and like , uh , you know positive f- and uplifting to us , people	positive	A	A	tn
ething which is also fun , it's positive because there's no drama happe	positive	A	A	tn
, and I want us to have like a positive word jar where like we put- wr	positive	A	A	tn
t gonna always be you know , a- positive things that are coming out of	positive	A	A	tn
ite something positive , ( laughing ) um , everyday and t	positive	A	A	tn
was supposed to uplift and be positive . And it was like their whole m	positive	A	A	tn
- I just I won't never cast my positive which is positive towards you	positive	A	A	tn
hree o'clock , I'm not- I'm not positive the time . N- this is a benefit	positive	A	A	tn
ey fail to sometime report the positive things that goes on in the tow	positive	A	A	tn
n . And I wanna see more positive things reported than negative	positive	A	A	tn
nceville . Cause there are some positive things in people over here . Yo	positive	A	A	tn
d some kids just need somebody positive- I'm- I think I'm a very posit	positive	A	A	tn
arents . My friends , I'm around positive people , I don't like negative	positive	A	A	tn
t . And I had- have had nothing positive because it always ended um , < t	positive	A	A	tn
nd- and it was- it was nothing positive to me , you know . Uh , lot of bl	positive	A	A	tn
r choices that were not always positive choices , and what that meant f	positive	A	A	tn
a peace of mind and be around positive people . Cause I think that's w	positive	A	A	tn
onsistently bringing out these positive vibes , you know , we're- gotta	positive	A	A	tn
ings out there . There are very positive programs in DC . My grandmother	positive	A	A	tn
body's negative , other half is positive . But , you could also perceive	positive	A	A	tn
inally have a image that is so positive and people can actually see us	positive	A	A	tn
ince . That was one of the most positive people I've ever met , man . Cau	positive	A	A	tn
ent , um , the mentality is more positive , people are more willing to he	positive	A	A	tn
become comfortable in a- in a positive light of being back home . Beca	positive	A	A	tn
. < laugh > So it has some- some positive things about it , you know . It-	positive	A	A	tn
off the street into something positive , creative , influential , fun , f	positive	A	A	tn
ings are going in direction- a positive direction in DC ch- as far as	positive	A	A	tn
, yeah . I hang around a lot of positive people , man . My closest friend	positive	A	A	tn
bout it . You know being- being positive I had learned a lot about it .	positive	A	A	tn
things . Just- Only thing I can positively remember uh , is that we- I pla	positively	R	PREVB	tp

ay , excuse me , was one- no way possible for me to make it , cause I was	possible	A	A	tn

tatistically that shouldn't be possible . But it's- it keeps happening	possible	A	A	tn
t view things as possible , and so they get stuck . Um , bu	possible	A	A	tn

And I'm like , yo like , this is powerful . And- and I would probably say	powerful	A	A	tn
your brain . And , uh- Mind is a powerful thing . Yeah , it's a powerful t	powerful	A	A	tn
the powerful movie that I seen , um , would h	powerful	A	A	tn

Side special and different and powerful is that everyone who came from	powerful	A	A	tn
I will say that words are very powerful , um , and especially in African	powerful	A	A	tn

Oh well , for that matter , I'm practically doing something all the time .	practically	R	PREVB	tp
, but um , I have to be sort of precarious about how I say it . Because on	precarious	A	A	tn
anted a little sister . She was precious . And , um , you know . Somebody I	precious	A	A	tn

it's- it's- it's gonna be all- predominantly white in a matter of years . An	predominantly	R	PREJJ	tp

. Well I am- went to school , a private school in New York for air con	private	A	A	tn
y life . And my sisters were in private school with me until they foun	private	A	A	tn

de , uh , it was a time when the private schools were , um , looking to d	private	A	A	tn
um , Carroll , which , is that a private school ? Yeah . Oh . Sorry . Yeah	private	A	A	tn
tudents than some of the other private schools that were also taking	private	A	A	tn

oming up in- when they were in private school , I was never well recei	private	A	A	tn
other school . Well this is the private- per- personal part of it . I h	private	A	A	tn

no different . Back then , they probably paid ' em , what ? Ten cent ? You	probably	R	PREVB	tp
m concerned to life , but uh , I probably would have them . < laugh > Mm-mm	probably	R	PREVB	tp
thruway versus interstate . You probably hear interstate on your side o	probably	R	PREVB	tp

add three uh two digit numbers probably without making a mistake , and	probably	R	PREVB	tp
just the way- and part of that probably , I'm sure had to do with the f	probably	R	PREVB	tp

any people in Princeville . You probably ? pretty much need a job Sara	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ho I need to be . It lasted for probably twenty-four hours I think- I d	probably	R	POSTVB	tp

Carlton Banks dude , like okay , probably like a black kid from Pittsfor	probably	R	PREVB	tp

on , I ever made , um , because I probably would have been postal or some	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ginning . And that's one of the probably the reason that um , they wante	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
tell her nothing else , she'll probably get it . You know , she really-	probably	R	PREVB	tp
yway , they did a record it was probably back in uh , back in the e- eig	probably	R	POSTVB	tp

she worked there- yeah ? Yeah , probably . < laugh > Um , and so like I gre	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
t ten years . ten , twelve years probably . Been a long time . What do you	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
o . Like I've been to Baltimore probably three times in my life . Know w	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
could be a lot of work . I mean probably when they get older , it'll be	probably	R	PREVB	tp
the city . Um , I mean , you had probably about a equal number of blacks	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
Oh , that's sh- Cincinnati , you probably talking about . The Bengals . Oh	probably	R	PREVB	tp

out there and get it . Hm . Man . Probably- < ts > Shit , I was probably abo	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
Yeah . Yeah . Sure did . Shoot , I probably no more about- about twelve . <	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ook at older people back then , probably got anywhere from nine to twel	probably	R	PREVB	tp
' ve ever tasted mumbo sauce . I probably have . I probably have tasted i	probably	R	PREVB	tp

g to shorty or whatever , so we probably talking for like a good week .	probably	R	PREVB	tp
our favorite on Disney ? Uh , it probably have to be- Uh , what was that	probably	R	PREVB	tp
he Godfellas- Goodfellows . Um , probably Paid in Full . ?? in Paid in Fu	probably	R	PREJJ	tp
down , a guy he come by , and he probably might- my feet might have been	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ike , some black kids that were probably on- You know , you- you don't h	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
get any kind of old costume . I probably put on a l- on a lady's dress	probably	R	PREVB	tp
he grew suspicion of this guy probably was in there , was hiding , beca	probably	R	PREVB	tp
, here's your money . And he'll probably say , go on , keep it . I hope he	probably	R	PREVB	tp
gay people . Because they will probably be the ones that will come to	probably	R	PREVB	tp
u go to unintelligible . That's probably why some of you acting like th	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ce places and stuff , they just probably big paying jobs in those place	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ll had , when I was growing up , probably around about third grade or so	probably	R	PREVB	tp
chool ? Trade school ? Um , I was probably about seventeen cause I- seven	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
le there . Mm-hm . Same problem . Probably , probably give you . Yeah . Of c	probably	R	PREVB	tp
know I didn't . I know we just probably- Our family members , you know	probably	R	PREVB	tp
. And had she had died , I'm- I probably would have had a heart attack .	probably	R	PREVB	tp
I probably would have had a heart attack .	probably	R	PREVB	tp

I probably would travel , uh , quite a bit .	probably	R	PREVB	tp
Uh . Man . I have to say it was probably , um , < name > . And < name > . Yes .	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
so certain- certain people you probably wouldn't be cool with if y'all	probably	R	PREVB	tp
- From the old interview you'd probably learn more about my neighborho	probably	R	PREVB	tp
king family in there , and they probably started paying whatever they p	probably	R	PREVB	tp
aying now . They probably pay fourteen , fifteen , sixteen	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ke , propelled me into business probably , just that understanding , know	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
nes . I know we didn't . So they probably had , uh , communication by lett	probably	R	PREVB	tp
And , uh , so my mother gave me probably a nickel or a dime or somethin	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
y Tech , when I was very young , probably about four- four years old . An	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
g- dime probably , < ts > and I had to go to the c	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
a heel on it . Now the heel was probably not one inch , you know . It's j	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ust i- probably a little shoe like that . If- i	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ren't even heels . < laugh > They probably about this high . I don't know .	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
hnuts now . I think some people probably call them fry cakes , don't the	probably	R	PREVB	tp
I don't know what that means . Probably back then I knew what it meant	probably	R	PREVB	tp
< laugh > And I think she l- she probably realized that I enjoyed doing	probably	R	PREVB	tp
would come out go left cause I probably was coming out a different doo	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ver found this out , they would probably send me a really big tuition b	probably	R	PREVB	tp
rlying theme of the school was probably more welcoming for black stude	probably	R	PREJJ	tp
Hardy and ef- That name brand probably is too less for them , but they	probably	R	PREVB	tp
now what we're gonna do . We'll probably go somewhere . My cousin lives	probably	R	PREVB	tp
was- it was- nah , it w- it was probably like- It wasn't no Al Green or	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
singers , I would guess it was probably like some Ginuwine , or- or- or	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
The oldest person in the band probably was like nineteen . It probably	probably	R	PREVB	tp
chup , uh , ? Ketchup , yeah , you probably mix it and got mumbo sauce , hu	probably	R	PREVB	tp
k students at the time . And we probably , percentage wise , probably had	probably	R	PREVB	tp
w what's going on , some people probably came up with some good shit , b	probably	R	PREVB	tp
long he lived out England , he probably lived out England for a few ye	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ward airport . Mm-hm . There was probably like the traditional three m-	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
remember my first home back in probably nineteen sixty . Three years ol	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ask that question I would have probably had the ch- I would have a cha	probably	R	PREVB	tp
in a mood to hear it- I- I'll probably well just sit there and look a	probably	R	PREVB	tp
? No he's a Jamaican nigga , he probably could speak French or somethin	probably	R	PREVB	tp
not gonna like me , um , or you probably not gonna like me . And I ain't	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
. Mm-mm . And so that- And it's probably the first time I really looked	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
I'm sure- I'm sure we did . We probably couldn't live where we wanted	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ght person . I guess . I mean , I probably want to have a child with a pa	probably	R	PREVB	tp
like what would make me- I was probably in about the eighth or ninth-	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ween baseball and hockey . It'd probably be a tie . Cause when my Capito	probably	R	PREVB	tp
Wizards . And probably- I don't know it's probably be	probably	R	PREVB	tp
na go celebrate with ? It would probably be my Redskins first , then my	probably	R	PREVB	tp
e title of that . But it- it'll probably come to me as I talk . Uh-huh .	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ay at a certain time at night , probably about nine or ten o'clock . See	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ere . But if it had been < ts > I probably woulda remember if it had been	probably	R	PREVB	tp
of things . I don't work a lot , probably about fifteen hours a week . Fi	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
e a year , a little over a year probably . When was that ? < laugh > I don '	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
rt- we started Lighthouse . Pr- probably around that time . Yep . Mm-hm .	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
d . I don't know . < laugh > I was probably just- I was like , I don't wann	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
tunity when it come , I'm'a be- probably go longer than Drake as far as	probably	R	PREVB	tp
een . Mm . < ts > Um . I wanna say , probably the late part of two thousand	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
hool reunion . And , I was like , probably about thirty , forty minutes aw	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
, she probably wanna choke the shit out of he	probably	R	PREVB	tp
uess I could say , at that age , probably about ten years old , you know ,	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
it all over again , I think I'd probably choose a online school . Cause	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ind of comedy . You know , like , probably be like the next Eddie Murphy .	probably	R	PREVB	tp
m getting older , you know , I'm probably won't even be qualified anyway	probably	R	PREVB	tp
Being a area coach , they make probably about seventy , eighty thousand	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ugh > So I was even being crazy probably just pull out the car and just	probably	R	PREVB	tp
said , you know , we need to go probably hang out , go to the movies . Ca	probably	R	PREVB	tp
hen she got that phone call , I probably just left . Probably about ten	probably	R	PREVB	tp
minutes ago . So she thought I probably mighta coulda been there to- t	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ldn't have even stop that . I'd probably a wait til she took all the mo	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ney out the safe and probably woulda whacked her on side of	probably	R	PREVB	tp
at ? You know . Cause I know she probably say if her parents wasn't here	probably	R	PREVB	tp
oking . Like i- half of it's n- probably not even real chicken half the	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ry store . But that Chick-fil-A probably brings in the most business , a	probably	R	PREVB	tp
listen to on a regular basis , probably on a Friday , like they say on	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
lls . I start working there um , probably my junior year . And uh , Yeah .	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ear shift was in the floor . It probably probably about fifteen hundred	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ool . I mean , I pl- I- I know i probably coulda did the school work , bu	probably	R	PREVB	tp
not Charlotte . Ch- Charlotte's probably two hours . But , Rocky I mean ,	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
< work > as a whole in Valdosta ? probably about t- between two fifty and	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
hen he was I think- AJ was um , probably about f- three or four . Someth	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
oulda- I don't know why , but I probably wouldn't have got in so much t	probably	R	PREVB	tp
a community type thing . Ooh I probably was about eight . About eight o	probably	R	PREVB	tp
wo or three of the children ?? probably lasted to ' em , say , you can't	probably	R	PREVB	tp
I met you at Antioch . You was probably in junior high school maybe ? U	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
logy , tryna focus in school . I probably would have just flunked high s	probably	R	PREVB	tp
is not there for me . But w- I probably should do that . It's getting k	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ind of cold now , but I probably should do it . Oh yeah ? Oh caus	probably	R	PREVB	tp
know , like I said before that probably would have moved away now they	probably	R	PREVB	tp
t I'm saying . I would- I would probably go before you and mama would .	probably	R	PREVB	tp
e . So I feel that I ( laughing ) probably , would be the first one to- so	probably	R	PREVB	tp
now in Atlanta , and there are probably at least five Migos songs play	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
hool , so Mr. Smith's class was probably my favorite . I remember enjoyi	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
lass . And I would say that was probably the start of getting into band	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
de , had to play . And those are probably some of the fondest memories g	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ent a lot of time outside . And probably some of our fondest and funnie	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
re that on < address > . Um , it's probably my favorite growing up , becaus	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
sold . Well , the stinging part probably would take one day , cause you	probably	R	PREVB	tp
would , uh probably take y'all a day to fill a bar	probably	R	PREVB	tp
e , say I- got . No , I- I did it probably until I was about f- about fif	probably	R	PREVB	tp
oes . I don't know why . There's probably nobody closer , ( laughing ) who	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ts > My favorite video game was probably WCW vs NWO , which is a wrestli	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ly had done before . Which , was probably all the more reason why I want	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
band directors together , that probably any band could ask for . Separa	probably	R	PREVB	tp
an just the music . So band was probably , the central part I would say	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
g . I- My sister kno- well , she probably do know , how much that , uh , I	probably	R	PREVB	tp
, other than the Bible , that's probably like a given , right ? Other tha	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ah , if- if I did take that was probably my least favorite too . Um , yea	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ble Laws of Leadership , that's probably my favorite book . Mm-hm . Mm-hm	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
nk that experience at < school > probably couldn't have set me up better	probably	R	PREVB	tp
y're probably still in there . Definitely hav	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
is interview ? Mm , okay . Oh . We probably definitely do . < laugh > Um , the	probably	R	PREVB	tp
I was in Hell Kitchen for like probably a year or so . I didn't make a	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
onkey bars into the the swings probably or something like that . Yeah .	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
until I was like , third grade probably . And then I only- I ain't went	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
and me . And those weekends was probably more of the weekends when I we	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ut to play with my emotions . I probably would , but I don't think it's	probably	R	PREVB	tp
me we- during the summer we're probably like , hanging around the pool .	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
d , that's why I wasn't- That's probably why it wasn't so affective to	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
eally liked pre-K . and I- it's probably because I got to nap , so it wa	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
d be in there , cause I know he probably be dressing up and really brin	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ing , I wouldn't tell it to her probably . Just cause I gotta make sure	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
be her little assistant . I'll probably go most of the time . How much	probably	R	PREVB	tp
n't- I don't- our tradition is probably going to my grandmother's hous	probably	R	PREVB	tp
stay down with it . Cause it's probably several other people doing the	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
, um , and that Chick-fil-A has probably got the most business probably	probably	R	PREVB	tp
you was probably about in um , about ten years o	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ike I could move to it , then I probably feel it . You know what I'm say	probably	R	PREVB	tp
come to live with me . And I'd probably have a swimming pool and maybe	probably	R	PREVB	tp
st black kids doin- in my age . Probably start working the ' bacca when	probably	R	PREVB	tp
. We stayed there at her house probably about < ts > s- I say eight . We	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
three . Mm-hm . We stayed there probably < ts > until I was about six may	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
iolent driven bands . Yeah . Mm , probably candy ladies . Candy lady's thi	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
lored man . And they figured he probably did it and uh , you know , he ha	probably	R	PREVB	tp
you leave public school . It's probably a false alarm or something . Oh	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
on it . If I wasn't from here I probably wouldn't like it either . I don	probably	R	PREVB	tp
getting older and from , when I probably was in middle school or high s	probably	R	PREVB	tp
t , I get them before Christmas probably . Um , I remember one Christmas	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
and I mean it's- it's t- it's probably gonna be like that . So when yo	probably	R	PREVB	tp
e , we- to a certain degree , it probably was maybe interfered in our re	probably	R	PREVB	tp
hat I wasn't enjoying it and I probably could not make money off of it	probably	R	PREVB	tp
would want to do , < ts > um , is probably be like an editor for like , a	probably	R	PREVB	tp
n seen it , so she's like gonna probably scream . But , I had very long h	probably	R	PREVB	tp
. Yeah . No , they gonna s- They probably gonna keep that . Our pastor , h	probably	R	PREVB	tp
Yeah . I knew she was- she was probably gonna pocket it , cause how com	probably	R	PREVB	tp
em . I wouldn't know them . They probably know me like , you look just li	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ke my mother , you know , that's probably it- cause some of ' em come up	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
me home . Yeah . On the weekends probably . It's not that far ! I went to	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
a place for ourselves . Um , it probably appealed to some people . I thi	probably	R	PREVB	tp
was just similar to DC . Which probably a lot of cities they had their	probably	R	PREVB	tp
who do come here some of them- probably a majority of them come in her	probably	R	PREVB	tp
from junior high school it was probably about seventy thirty , black to	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
m-hm . to where when you got to probably about nineteen sixty seven it	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
probably started my career in , opening	probably	R	PREVB	tp

five friends that you may have probably know me or one of your other . -	probably	R	PREVB	tp
' s- still I was making good- I probably was making more than anybody e	probably	R	PREVB	tp
d to take a leave , mother , you probably take a mother fucking week and	probably	R	PREVB	tp
nd so I was on social services probably for like a year and a half and	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
nguage . So I tease him that he probably shoulda been educated as an ES	probably	R	PREVB	tp
on Lane or Woodland , they were probably the most powerful thug within	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ely could see myself visiting , probably wouldn't wanna go any , uh , any	probably	R	PREVB	tp
h , I'm assuming my grandmother probably left something behind there th	probably	R	PREVB	tp

of- of- of nineteen ninety was probably the best last graduat- no ( lau	probably	R	POSTVB	tp

I think < laugh > as a child and probably now it was just like , okay . So	probably	R	PREVB	tp
like- See I w- < laugh > < name > probably don't understand this but I'm	probably	R	PREVB	tp
but I think the scariest time probably- I'm probably probably telling	probably	R	PREVB	tp
, no then I would say U Street probably is my favorite there now . Yeah	probably	R	PREVB	tp
d I don't bow down to you , you probably take me over there and kill me	probably	R	PREVB	tp
CNA by then . And , um , working probably as a traveling nurse . And , um ,	probably	R	POSTVB	tp

really good pair of shoes , you probably spending like a hundred and so	probably	R	PREVB	tp
-hm . Uh , on a typical weekend , probably go out . to a party , or to a cl	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ah I wanna get next to her . We probably still saying that now . < laugh >	probably	R	PREVB	tp
igure fifty- And I know it had probably been there prior to us being t	probably	R	PREVB	tp
everything in here so you can probably imagine how her house look . He	probably	R	PREVB	tp
t us . Let me get this . This is probably my mother . ( tape stops ) I mean	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ove Powell Park . My front yard probably would have rested somewhat rig	probably	R	PREVB	tp

AM stations stayed until about probably the late sixties and then FM s	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
. I don't know . But , a hot dog probably was a nickel back then . I don '	probably	R	PREVB	tp
longer . And Mrs. < name > , she's probably in a nursing home if she's sti	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
f the psych center . So , that's probably how they met . And , when her hu	probably	R	POSTVB	tp

ger one , he's fifty-four . He's probably worried too . But , I hope he li	probably	R	PREJJ	tp
ecause my sergeant says so I'd probably just go into jail . Which , I do	probably	R	PREVB	tp
your birthday , so . I- I think probably- probably about the birthday .	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
I come this afternoon ? I said probably maybe one thirty , two o'clock .	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
umber of white people and then probably around sixty six you would see	probably	R	PREVB	tp

ly hard . < ts > Parties ? My nin- probably my ninth birthday party . I rem	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
a fact , they got married like probably when we got out of high school	probably	R	PREVB	tp

out six , seven , roughly , I was probably about six . About six . Yeah . Mm	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
Eleven students probably . And that's the average . And t	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ible for the last what , decade probably . But I think- I think they hav	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
passed like , two thousand and- probably four years ago now , so . But- b	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
neties . Um , I would say I lost probably seventeen friends to- to- gun	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
cause it was inexpensive . So I probably would go to Like a Keith and S	probably	R	PREVB	tp
near my house on MLK , which is probably two miles from here . Um , they '	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
t yelled at ? Occasionally . Oh , probably because I was late . Yeah . I me	probably	R	POSTVB	tp

ht , I'll tell you that . It was probably the same thing for like a rap	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
to be on drugs because it was probably there , and I just didn't see i	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
etal or some rock band , that's probably one of the hardest crowds you	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
. Um , and from the East River , probably over to Broadway . Okay . Which	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
sla- slave galleries , um would probably provide enough information you	probably	R	PREVB	tp
what I wanted to do and that's probably changed . But , what I've been d	probably	R	PREVB	tp
er . I like extreme shoots . I'd probably cut my hair again if someone a	probably	R	PREVB	tp
guess now looking back it was probably beautiful , but at the time it	probably	R	PREJJ	tp
se . Except for my hair . That's probably just a curse . But It's pretty	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
tate . You know . So . I think it probably should be everybody who lives	probably	R	PREVB	tp
typing a little bit more . I'll probably be a clerk typist , something l	probably	R	PREVB	tp

those are the people who would probably talk to me and start a convers	probably	R	PREVB	tp
e for y'all to get here . Y'all probably out somewhere drinking . You're	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
has a very hot song , but I've probably maybe played that song once or	probably	R	PREVB	tp
e- maybe even early seventies , probably like in the eighties some time	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
audible . ( whispered ) And I was probably just hitting twenty one . I use	probably	R	PREVB	tp
e School's been up , I know it , probably since like the sixties at leas	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
finished tryna spend it all , I probably be gone by now . First thing I	probably	R	PREVB	tp
or rich . Um , I'd say that was probably the last days of the middle cl	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
t we sorry so and so's and you probably somewhere drinking so we had u	probably	R	PREVB	tp
than a day . And back then , it probably took them a week , maybe two . B	probably	R	PREVB	tp
s w- I could be well today and probably go to the doctor's , and he wou	probably	R	PREVB	tp
' re not underneath there . They probably kept on through back to the ot	probably	R	PREVB	tp
f they thirty cent . Cause they probably- most of ' em get free lunch . T	probably	R	PREVB	tp
udson . She was in that area in probably like the fifties . And , uh , one	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
he used to work against me . He probably thought um man , and this is wh	probably	R	PREVB	tp
hat's Dot's brother . Which you probably don't know him . He's from Tamp	probably	R	PREVB	tp
you know , individuals . He knew probably all us had done it cause all u	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
thing their teacher might say probably upsets them you know . And , it	probably	R	PREVB	tp
and deep on the East Side are probably like in the city . Yes like , bu	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ut I would say those areas are probably considered the worst . And then	probably	R	PREVB	tp
nattractive to the ear . That's probably because I'm from here . Maybe o	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
your neighborhood . And that's probably one of the- as far as a heavy	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
it together like that . And you probably get mumbo sauce . < laugh > But I	probably	R	PREVB	tp
d together ? Mixed together . Or probably it's a- there's some water . Mi	probably	R	PREVB	tp
mixed . My guess would be . It's probably barbecue sauce , hot sauce , jus	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
me see . Uh , my g- guess would probably be like barbecue sauce , and ho	probably	R	PREVB	tp
a do together ? Growing up . Mm . Probably just when we went to the park	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ge we ain't never fight . We'll probably argue or say something , like s	probably	R	PREVB	tp
of how big our family was . We probably couldn't get everything we wan	probably	R	PREVB	tp
wo years . Three , maybe . But probably at the- I say at the least it '	probably	R	PREVB	tp
came about < cough > I would say probably about a year , probably about t	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ugh > In DC- I done lived in DC probably about , um , since I was born to	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ld host something and it would probably be really fun . But I just feel	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ing touchdowns . And then w- we probably split up into teams , play a ro	probably	R	PREVB	tp
six kids . Um , so < school > was probably the beginning of me trying to	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
and we went outside . You know , probably just normal stuff cause like w	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
favorite subject was probably math or science . Yeah , man , hi	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
the best hands . And then they probably see if- if you were a lover an	probably	R	PREVB	tp
d growing . < laugh > So now it's probably this guy I was telling you abo	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
on engineer or something . Well probably in the industry you know when	probably	R	PREVB	tp
Um , I don't know , first I- I'd probably put some into poverty you know	probably	R	PREVB	tp
I see him in the hall , and he probably get on me for something once i	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ll I'm take the Barber's Board probably , in um , June . I mean in April .	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
t for everybody < laugh > I'd b- probably buy myself a private island ou	probably	R	PREVB	tp
irst of all , being a Negro I'd probably have to straighten out the rac	probably	R	PREVB	tp
my least favorite teacher was probably , hm , uh , it was a s- ah , least	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
d be happy . You know . Then um , probably try and help out- you know try	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ike Hide and Seek ? Ha , yeah . I probably did . I really can't- you know	probably	R	PREVB	tp
I can go in the Post Office . I probably be a mail carrier . What would	probably	R	PREVB	tp
t of sports . Uh , I usually was probably the only girl that like , got d	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
Yeah it was < name > , and it was probably his um- his dad , or maybe him	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
a . Mm-hm . Okay . Cause they can probably tell you more things than I ca	probably	R	PREVB	tp
st take me out with him . And I probably just be sitting out there with	probably	R	PREVB	tp
he- the ? most important thing probably is seeing how well you can fig	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ery hard to choose one . Mm , it probably would be maybe just like , goin	probably	R	PREVB	tp
of a guy you are . First they'd probably take you- See if you know how	probably	R	PREVB	tp
yes . I was in the way up until probably when I became about fifteen or	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
Um , it- it- it's a PWI , as you probably already know . Um , we had our i	probably	R	PREVB	tp
dn't ask to go do ' em . So I c- probably caused some of my structured a	probably	R	PREVB	tp
h , yeah , all day . He has- he's probably superseded Denzel's numbers ca	probably	R	PREVB	tp
saying , it's , uh , Jamie Foxx , probably the dopest . Yeah , absolutely .	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
won't say all , but I would say probably thirty percent was kind of boa	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
. Wow . Um , thanks to my sister probably on- during the summer , more on	probably	R	PREVB	tp
I figured we- we- we they was probably , like that was the guy that wa	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
nd we were still young . He was probably was sixteen , or fifteen at the	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ry true . Literally , I was like probably like fourteen , fifteen . Fourte	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
augh > Yeah . They- < laugh > They probably did . That's probably what happ	probably	R	PREVB	tp
n I forgot what happened . We'd probably do it all over again . You know	probably	R	PREVB	tp
nna happen anymore . So , that's probably The- some of th- Yeah . The rea	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ortus and Black Boy Fly . And I probably would put Black Boy Fly over R	probably	R	PREVB	tp
to an air conditioned car . And probably travel . I think . Yes . And the	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ot more now . We see each other probably on a weekly basis . As far as t	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ing . In elementary school . Mm , probably was fair . Yeah that was my six	probably	R	PREJJ	tp
like circle a lot . And then we probably like , all start coming togethe	probably	R	PREVB	tp
riend of mine wa- he- he- he's probably retired now , he had been a cop	probably	R	PREJJ	tp
l the time . And that was like , probably like , a mile , or two . Um , you	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
n just because the houses will probably s- remain s- with the family .	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ke sh- worn out shoes that she probably shouldn't be wearing anymore b	probably	R	PREVB	tp
all the city schools . Uh-huh , probably about ten or twelve , was that	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
h . Yep . Basically um , many of- probably ninety eight percent of my fri	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ike three miles . You know . Um , probably almost not quite a mile , but p	probably	R	PREVB	tp
e seventeen , you feel me , like probably like eighteen . You feel me . Mi	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ight be like ten , eleven , and- probably ten . That- but you know , nigga	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ct we gonna play that bitch in probably like the next five ten minutes	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
is powerful . And- and I would probably say we ended up with like , thr	probably	R	PREVB	tp
, like , local artists . I would probably make it like , a tri-city type	probably	R	PREVB	tp
So it wasn't that many people probably in town . At that time , you pro	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
did a lot of swimming . That's probably why we some good swimmers now .	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
to school there which was only probably a hundred yards from my house .	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
er anything . And at that age I probably wouldn't have cared . You know ,	probably	R	PREVB	tp
< laugh > I probably wouldn't have noticed it , so u	probably	R	PREVB	tp
out there . Um , I think CCB is probably my favorite . Um , and it's a v-	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
er . Um chemistry I guess would probably be my favorite , but right now	probably	R	PREVB	tp
der graduate school which will probably be necessary , um , I should ima	probably	R	PREJJ	tp
to me , and I- I guess I'd- I'd probably end up doing the same thing th	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ake that shit to the point you probably only can grow you two plants .	probably	R	PREVB	tp
sand five , and , um , I was home probably like- probably like three , fou	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
the way they going , they could probably run about a good nother ten ye	probably	R	PREVB	tp
e- a- d- like I- that shit was probably like s- about six , seven years	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ith the neighborhood as m- uh , probably like exactly two minutes away	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
somebody on a skateboard , they probably think it's funny to uh , shoot	probably	R	PREVB	tp
f you left it there . The water probably took it to somebody else house	probably	R	PREVB	tp
h , I ain't catch that bitch . I probably was binging on mother fucking	probably	R	PREVB	tp
use in my opinion , he's probably been in more movies . Mm-hm . So	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ggled at all I think in fact I probably wasn't challenged enough a lot	probably	R	PREVB	tp
you know , you dig . But nah , I probably was binging , bro . I probably h	probably	R	PREVB	tp
I got into < school > , but I'll probably go with St. John Fisher , and t	probably	R	PREVB	tp
t decision . Uh , and I think it probably disappointed , um , some of my f	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ed to live my life over again ? Probably not o- ah- sitting here . I'd b	probably	R	PREVB	tp
times for voter roles and they probably think that they're registered	probably	R	PREVB	tp
se . Now I eat a slice of bread probably and have a cup of coffee somet	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
here's a little white thing at probably air conditioner with the corne	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ything like that . I was- I was probably about I say about nine years o	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
But I ain't gonna even lie , I probably was binging on Netflix for rea	probably	R	PREVB	tp
in the county . And uh , we get probably EMS calls , which we , uh , ?? re	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
father . Um , I'm pretty sure he probably told you that too . And that's-	probably	R	PREVB	tp
< laugh > Mm-hmm . < ts > From- at- probably . Some of that stuff I don't re	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
t shift , but I'm assuming that probably coincided with them being able	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ildren , and if I hit ' em , they probably gonna get their mother . Cause	probably	R	PREVB	tp
I have to retake those . It'll probably be a year in total once I fini	probably	R	PREVB	tp
rginia , and my um , mom I guess probably just got tired of living with	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ntistry . And he- I don't know , probably at first , it probably takes ab	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ve , but first two years or so , probably , is just book work and learnin	probably	R	PREVB	tp
And at that time , their perm- probably weren't many housing developme	probably	R	PREVB	tp
nt with the girl , I dumped her probably like four times . Like , The who	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
and , maybe , I don't know , they probably require to take courses on how	probably	R	PREVB	tp
back then . < ts > Um , they could probably tell you a lot more than I cou	probably	R	PREVB	tp
Suitland Road . Which was only probably like four miles from DC actual	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
d all three of ' em on a Friday probably made a lot of money . And that '	probably	R	PREVB	tp
was just like- But if somebody probably woulda got hurt we probably wo	probably	R	PREVB	tp
other dentsits , and then they probably get about two years of experie	probably	R	PREVB	tp
u know . Working and well like , probably like a free clinic or somethin	probably	R	PREVB	tp
it another car or anything . It probably just had a flat tire or someth	probably	R	PREVB	tp
uding visiting family members , probably like seven or eight times over	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
lerate that stuff . I mean . Um , probably some of the friends I had . I w	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
hot him . And people told me he probably coulda got away if he hadn't f	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ve never been out west . That's probably the only place I haven't been .	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
f music . But yeah . I think CCB probably . I love Mumbo Sauce , too . Um ,	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
double major with drama , probably would have done well with that	probably	R	PREVB	tp
uck with . Although I ( breathy ) probably should have switched or tried	probably	R	PREVB	tp
more aside in bank accounts . I probably would get myself an insurance	probably	R	PREVB	tp
And < ts > I want- the rest , I'd probably just put it to- to use , making	probably	R	PREVB	tp
, so . Yeah , but that's- that's probably my favorite TV show . Um , and l	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
hings , so Law and Order SVU is probably my favorite TV show . Honestly .	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
- wasn't necessarily- but it's probably not actually ketchup in there ,	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
. Uh , well my favorite one was probably my , uh , my Spanish teacher . Ca	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
to life , and I know my father probably didn't go into great detail . L	probably	R	PREVB	tp
course of the year . Um , I say probably no more than ten times a year ,	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
to get here , your perspective probably would've been totally differen	probably	R	PREJJ	tp
t know if you know < name > ? You probably do know her , yeah she's- um , s	probably	R	PREVB	tp
name > I'm pretty sure you- you probably know exactly who she is , but s	probably	R	PREVB	tp
d : You Only Live Twice . That's probably about the last one I saw . RKO	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ng around the house a lot . Mm , probably going out on dates and things .	probably	R	PREVB	tp
id enjoy Charlotte , so . That's probably the only place . Um , I love Mia	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
es or whatever . < laugh > That's probably the only thing I remember abou	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ant at fifteen so , I had to be probably like , eleven , twelve years old	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
e , so I had to be no more than probably like eleven . I was like eleven	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
and help them do that , and we probably gonna give them some money so	probably	R	PREVB	tp
honest . < cough > I probably woulda killed him . < ts > But , u	probably	R	PREVB	tp
kid and I drove off because I probably woulda killed that man , to be	probably	R	PREVB	tp
had to learn like that . I was probably like four . And that's how I le	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
stuff gonna be there . Like you probably come home and your stuff is go	probably	R	PREVB	tp
I'll probably go see my little brother stay	probably	R	PREVB	tp
y here at the < work > then I'll probably go home for a little while , or	probably	R	PREVB	tp
might try and rob you or they probably try to kill you , or stuff like	probably	R	PREVB	tp
say even though I know they're probably gonna choke at some point in t	probably	R	PREVB	tp
e you got close up on him , you probably be like , oh okay , he got curly	probably	R	PREVB	tp
a was locked up . Nigga , that's probably the reason everybody started m	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
But , um , if it was up to me , I probably would've been a percussionist .	probably	R	PREVB	tp
me . And my other friends were probably like , in band but band friends	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
he thought I was by myself . I probably coulda made it down there , but	probably	R	PREVB	tp
o my junior and senior year , I probably only had like , one or two frie	probably	R	PREVB	tp
looking back now , some people probably say , yeah it was kind of like	probably	R	PREVB	tp
here . And see it all < laugh > I probably won't make it this time . < laug	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ut when I'm conscious of it , I probably sound more like a New Yorker t	probably	R	PREVB	tp
that we say to each other . It probably won't come out here cause I'm	probably	R	PREVB	tp
to school . Okay . So there are probably a lot of different reasons why	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
e difference . Um , so resources probably were a l- I don't know . I didn	probably	R	PREVB	tp
your shit . And you gon- and I probably shock you with this . I'm not g	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ide don't come back , Then they probably can do it in five . But we not	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ighway . And we lived there for probably like- probably like , what like	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
mumbo sauce in so many years I probably wouldn't know what it taste li	probably	R	PREVB	tp
e line . Catch me another fare , probably goes somewheres else , maybe go	probably	R	PREVB	tp
know . Mm , not- Chinese food's probably about the only thing I do carr	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
lowed in the house until I was probably about eighteen . Then he was a-	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
the realest shit I could ever probably say out my mouth on the record	probably	R	PREVB	tp
< name > . Yes I do . I lived here probably all my life . Yes I was . Freedm	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
nd generally you gonna ha- you probably gonna have a metal detector yo	probably	R	PREVB	tp
he same level . Um , I would say probably educationally , financially- th	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ew York . Honestly , New York is probably the only place I could think o	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
' s a s- It's a dance that will probably last a long time . I think they	probably	R	PREVB	tp
say that I hate them . I'm- I'm probably more selective about which one	probably	R	PREJJ	tp
as a little bit later . This is probably when I was in college and l- a	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
w all about them and too young probably to be in some of them . Uh , < la	probably	R	POSTJJ	tp
then the other memory is the- probably the one beating , um , spanking	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
u know , I don't think- Well he probably could . I'm not gonna say he ca	probably	R	PREVB	tp
n first responder level , so we probably get three times as many those	probably	R	PREVB	tp
dn't hear it as a fireman , you probably didn't respond . You know , so o	probably	R	PREVB	tp
in downstown and the water was probably several feet already , that was	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
my mom . They had got there in probably less than ten minutes . And so	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
op , it's not even a c o-o p it's probably privatized h- apartments now .	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ratchet . And so like- Uh- Oh , probably- When did we go ? I want to say	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
erybody in Tarboro probably worked there . Yeah . Done worke	probably	R	PREVB	tp
it is now . It'll change names probably like five , six time in the las	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
I went to high school with who probably didn't get into college of the	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ted driving . That accident was probably like < name > probably like , ten	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
t now . I wouldn't even know . I probably wouldn't recognize ' em on the	probably	R	PREVB	tp
seums and stuff like that . No . Probably just on field trips . But um , w	probably	R	PREVB	tp
there . Yeah , in like the last probably five years . You know , they kee	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
tana and some other- And I was probably fourteen , fifteen . My- my girl	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
and I were sitting- fourteen- probably fourteen . And there was some c	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
he only time- I- I will say we probably- They- They was in the house p	probably	R	PREVB	tp
his particular instance , um , I probably- Now that I think back over it	probably	R	PREVB	tp
t probably- No . probably more then ? They- Cause they ch	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
Enterprise . You know , they're probably the oldest company . I think ev	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
bs . You have some folks that's probably welding , some of ' em probably	probably	R	PREVB	tp
d twenty- probably a good twenty stitches . Yeah ,	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
udible So we was- we stayed up probably all night just evacuating peop	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
say Georgia , cause I think we probably stayed there < psh > probably ab	probably	R	PREVB	tp
out- pro- probably wasn't a month . And then like	probably	R	PREVB	tp
think so . High school , was a- probably about a hundred times more soc	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ocial time . And I think that's probably what my fondest memory of midd	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
er days . Yeah . Tell you , h- he probably would . Yeah , he probably will .	probably	R	PREVB	tp
in- You come in in the morning probably about three to five minutes . T	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
And after that , I stayed there probably another month . Probably a mont	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
m , most of my fondest memories probably happened in the gym where , uh ,	probably	R	PREVB	tp
g about middle school was , um , probably getting to meet , um , a lot of	probably	R	PREVB	tp
as offered some Cornish hen , I probably would take it . Yes . Well it- i	probably	R	PREVB	tp
u know , as long as I live I'll probably never forget . < ts > Um , I- I re	probably	R	PREVB	tp
er doing some things that , um , probably twenty-five , thirty years ago ,	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
e I didn't go to college . They probably went to college . You know , thi	probably	R	PREVB	tp
t probably is . Yep . Mm-hm . But I need to .	probably	R	PREVB	tp
onal- Mm-hm . tivity . Yeah that probably is . Bus- Something to Yeah tha	probably	R	PREVB	tp
I- As I think about it now , w- probably to keep him out of trouble . Bu	probably	R	PREVB	tp
re . At Carolina Enterprise and probably Glenoit . Glenoit . It's the onl	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
monarch butterfly came and sat probably where you are from me . And it	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
this time , I don't know . It's probably like eight o'clock at night . M	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
, I was just a girl . They were probably interested in me more because	probably	R	PREJJ	tp
I was married . I was probably more- a- ap- i- I probably app	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ed like a lot to us . If it was probably more than three , it was a lot .	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
hat person . Not knowing that's probably why they're in the situations	probably	R	PREVB	tp
or lost time . And I think that probably one of the realest conversatio	probably	R	PREVB	tp
bit uneasy because I'm like , I probably stick out like a sore thumb , b	probably	R	PREVB	tp
like- that- that was- I would probably say that was home . Like , over	probably	R	PREVB	tp
It's been so long . I'm for- He probably was- Mm-hm . And just like I se	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ot to my senior year , I sat on probably like five different senior com	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
th anyone like me . And they're probably f- trying to figure out , um , w	probably	R	PREVB	tp
e . And , I had the opportunity , probably around when I was like sevente	probably	R	PREVB	tp
e- I think we ended up serving probably like a hundred and fifty kids ,	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
say from like , three to t- to probably six years old ? So that's the o	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
oo much . Like , it's- it's just probably just me and my little sister a	probably	R	PREVB	tp
Philly people I guess cause t- probably- t- probably- they probably wa	probably	R	PREVB	tp
t like a big bus then we could probably do that eventually . Like a tou	probably	R	PREVB	tp
Then had to get uh , mm , I was probably about phew- prob- be about goo	probably	R	POSTVB	tp

you know , you'd be surprised- probably have- but we have a big backya	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ifferent programs and stuff , I probably woulda chose a different caree	probably	R	PREVB	tp

hey weren't there , we- I would probably be in the house playing with m	probably	R	PREVB	tp
sn't until I really got older , probably like high school , college that	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
I- I never forgot . And he was probably my favorite teacher in high sc	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
- I s- From my preteens up and probably til my first years in high sch	probably	R	PREVB	tp
Yeah , no . < laugh > Yeah . Like , probably thirteen years . Okay . The Offi	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
n like buy something ? Well I'd probably buy a nightclub , a package sto	probably	R	PREVB	tp
aid I did something , < laugh > I probably did it , but I lied . < laugh > I	probably	R	PREVB	tp
I like that . < ts > So those are probably my favorites . I don't remember	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
it definitely has changed . I'm probably not- one , I'm not very observa	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
like a sweet and sour sauce is probably the closest , uh , thing I can t	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
niversity . Columbia Heights is probably close . Yes I have . Um , the far	probably	R	PREJJ	tp
y thought that this , you know , probably came from knowing that she had	probably	R	PREVB	tp
g , but the average student was probably around- Freshman , was about tw	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
hing that I need . < laugh > So I probably won't . But- like when we get o	probably	R	PREVB	tp
aring to go on a cruise , so . I probably won't go . Cause I haven't pack	probably	R	PREVB	tp
uff . I think for me H Street I probably witnessed the most because I'v	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ou know , thirteen , at probably age of thirteen . You know , I h	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ere my aunt lived at . And then probably a few months later , I wanna sa	probably	R	PREVB	tp
hroat > well , when I was a kid , probably- I wanna say I was in middle s	probably	R	PREVB	tp
new people and stuff , but they probably were not . Because we- I only t	probably	R	PREVB	tp
towards me . So now I was like , probably like fighting all the time in	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ite subject in high school was probably , um , history . Uh , I ran into m	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
, I was- funny thing is , I was probably more closer to my dad's side o	probably	R	PREJJ	tp
about law school . I should've probably gotten an MBA but you know hin	probably	R	PREVB	tp
went home and changed clothes probably two or three times just to get	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ou um , < ts > I feel like that's probably why she was my favorite . First	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
ould be . You know , and she was probably but one of the few that stayed	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
and all she saw was water ??? probably this high . And she knew it was	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
. < laugh > Yeah , so we actually probably played a major major role in h	probably	R	PREVB	tp
here just out of a guess , they probably woulda been in trouble . And yo	probably	R	PREVB	tp
a- popping sound or a- < laugh > probably wouldn't have been able to get	probably	R	PREVB	tp
wonder . You know , it was only probably a good fifteen feet away from	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
bit , it's a little eerie . It's probably not the right reason to like o	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
it was . And now I think it got probably a foot from being completely t	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
don't know that . Then they'll probably look back on it same as we do	probably	R	PREVB	tp
y'll do that . < laugh > Actually probably when I was- I would say thirty	probably	R	PREVB	tp
you know , um- ? Uh , I remember probably about eight to nine years ago	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
rms of like second family , I'm probably < ts > as close to them as my da	probably	R	PREJJ	tp
ngout type situation . Which is probably not helpful for you . Oh okay .	probably	R	PREJJ	tp
e I got there . Um , so that was probably a big shift for me , it was a b	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
like the three maybe n- that's probably a lie , th- outside maybe like	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
f things tied up into it like- probably should've taken these off . I-	probably	R	PREVB	tp
I saw the pictures and it was probably about that much from being fro	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
a day program before that , so probably for like , three years between	probably	R	PREVB	tp
So , m- I came here with like , probably eight or nine of other < school	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
you know . Um , but Chinese food probably would be the only thing , and-	probably	R	PREVB	tp
wh- somebody is back- There's probably like eight of us . And she star	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
e , I can't speak for now , it's probably worse . But they don't really c	probably	R	PREJJ	tp
i- the life experiences that I probably would have missed by continuin	probably	R	PREVB	tp
l of those things . Um , < ts > it probably was moving to that area that k	probably	R	PREVB	tp
I'm trying to think . No . I've probably only been in two car accidents	probably	R	PREVB	tp
uch . Whereas like , Virginia is probably program funded cause the paren	probably	R	PREJJ	tp
me > . He was a older dude . Like probably like four years older than us .	probably	R	PREVB	tp
then , I said < ts > I was about probably my mid-twenties , and that's wh	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
' s happening , you know . That's probably was one of , some of their reas	probably	R	PREVB	tp
on the farm until I was about- probably about twelve years old , then t	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
verturning the system , which I probably will have to get out of my min	probably	R	PREVB	tp
e- Yes . You know , that- that's probably uh , more attainable than a mil	probably	R	PREJJ	tp
d um , New Jersey . Stayed there probably- probably about just about thr	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
, he had a practice that would probably get him fired , if he was worki	probably	R	PREVB	tp
brother , whatever , would have probably been in jail . Right . Right , ri	probably	R	PREVB	tp
some coins . Um , So that- that probably'd be the advice I'd give , thin	probably	R	PREVB	tp
-five , no . Um , < laugh > I would probably say about , fifteen total . Yeah	probably	R	PREVB	tp
song Welcome to DC actually . I probably shouldn't like the song but ha	probably	R	PREVB	tp
ke . But in some ways , that was probably a blessing for me , because if	probably	R	POSTVB	tp
rt , you know ? Uh , uh , nah , uh , probably- you know , in probably like , y	probably	R	PREVB	tp
I remember that . Mm-hm . Yeah , probably a- like a month after . W- Like	probably	R	PREVB	tp
m , ninth grade , and then like , probably the last quarter- like , the fo	probably	R	PREVB	tp

eel like < ts > I feel like I've probably eaten at them maybe when I was	probably	R	PREVB	tp
< ts > Mm . I would think that I probably wouldn't have much advice for	probably	R	PREVB	tp
checking all the bubbles . So I probably coulda got way higher , if I wo	probably	R	PREVB	tp

And to see that change happen rapidly , it's a shame . Cause right now	rapidly	R	POSTVB	tp
ls that were developing pretty rapidly , to a wider audience . We're no	rapidly	R	POSTVB	tp
ere Harlem is being gentrified rapidly . You've got churches buying pr	rapidly	R	POSTVB	tp

gative things , like , it's like rare you hear DC as something posit	rare	A	A	tn
or landing . And- But that was rare . You didn't- That wasn't somet	rare	A	A	tn
s but it's just like something rare . And I feel like it's a blessi	rare	A	A	tn
ple from high school , but it's rare because so many people have dr	rare	A	A	tn

a , I've never- I've never hea- rarely hear people with my last name ,	rarely	R	PREVB	tp
together . So , it w- you would rarely see black and white people han	rarely	R	PREVB	tp

there's three colors . Uh , very rarely do you see a cocker with more	rarely	R	PREVB	tp

e try to be like more I guess , realistic with it , you know what I'm say	realistic	A	A	tn
but uh , you know , they not too realistic . It was a good part , he played	realistic	A	A	tn

o this . Like I'm always been a realistic , don't- don't do this . It was	realistic	A	A	tn
s uh , it just didn't seem very realistic . And uh , those were the parts	realistic	A	A	tn
they're not too uh- you know , realistic- they uh , the people they play	realistic	A	A	tn
when a person was shot and how realistic it looked . Like when they was	realistic	A	A	tn
good are you at editing ? Is it realistic ? Like , we get somewhere , and y	realistic	A	A	tn
this is wild . I'm like , cause realistically , they didn't have to lock me u	realistically	R	PREVB	tp
and get me a new job , but like realistically , the type of money I make , I n	realistically	R	PREVB	tp
was a war on the youth . Like , realistically , you're like , oh , now you got	realistically	R	PREVB	tp
now they got talent , but like , realistically I know people that's better th	realistically	R	PREVB	tp
, but a lot of these niggas is really intelligent . And I use the nig	really	R	PREJJ	tp
do . But , n- that was , that was really cool . Like , I'm I di- I felt s	really	R	PREJJ	tp
and he went to see her , which really surprised him . You know they w	really	R	PREVB	tp
ing- he's speaking shit that's really relevantly going on in the wor	really	R	PREVB	tp

ry nice and very neat . How she really love him , and he really love h	really	R	PREVB	tp
up running off with each other really . Well actually before then she	really	R	POSTVB	tp
really messed the boy's life up , and	really	R	PREVB	tp
I don- I don't know . It wasn't really a trick . They just took the te	really	R	POSTVB	tp
could be something I watch . I really couldn't tell ' em because what	really	R	PREVB	tp
e not really meeting them . Hi Sugar Plum . Y	really	R	PREVB	tp
it be true . Cause really nowadays you can't say nothing	really	R	PREVB	tp
. And so that's why I think r- really amazes me , you know , and could	really	R	PREVB	tp
adhesive tape on there , which really wasn't too hard to get off but	really	R	PREVB	tp
w what I mean . Like everything really got real fucked up down there ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
- more that what motherfuckers really actually even think , you feel .	really	R	PREVB	tp
ound us , you know . And I'm not really too much of a physicist , but I	really	R	POSTVB	tp
it was at a time when we were really just really F-ed up in the str	really	R	PREJJ	tp
hen , Char- like me and him was really - was kicking until about the	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ago , and the uh course doesn't really change from year to year . So t	really	R	PREVB	tp
one I learned the most from , I really couldn't say either . I don't k	really	R	PREVB	tp
up or something . Well , I don't really know . Best teacher . Well , I gu	really	R	PREVB	tp
you , but you know , they never really hollered at you or anything . H	really	R	PREVB	tp
re and things , and he wouldn't really go over the material sometimes	really	R	PREVB	tp
ot some of the other programs . Really to tell the truth if someone w	really	R	PREVB	tp
ns anymore . Yeah . Well , no not really . I don't know . Well about this	really	R	POSTVB	tp
my friend then , but he wasn't really my best friend at that time . T	really	R	POSTVB	tp
eleventh grade . But , I really got started really meeting mor	really	R	PREVB	tp
t I don't know . But that w- it really wasn't anything serious . I don	really	R	PREVB	tp
stly , I'm a hustler . I really don't have an occupation . When	really	R	PREVB	tp
and stuff like that . For like really getting to know ' em . And then ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
like , just , really adventures , like . For example .	really	R	POSTVB	tp
So , that was pretty lit . It's really just like people- how mu- how	really	R	POSTVB	tp
hen I was playing , it was just really close It was fire . It- Well , i	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ng time , all you have to do is really feed ' em insects , mice , any sm	really	R	PREVB	tp
use I got a attitude , but that really um , affects the opportunities	really	R	PREVB	tp
hat were going on . Uh , I'm not really into politics , but it's nothin	really	R	POSTVB	tp
like intensifying people . that really try to make sacks . It- it's- i	really	R	PREVB	tp
Right tackle , it's cause wasn- really depended on what side the ball	really	R	PREVB	tp
about every thing on the line , really , like a lot of different stuff	really	R	POSTVB	tp
You know , cause I really wasn't interested in ' em . Caus	really	R	PREVB	tp
Well , when I was a kid , really I didn't play too many games .	really	R	PREVB	tp
ing to warmer climate . But I'm really attached to my family and I ca	really	R	PREVB	tp
you got two kids you really can't have a set occupation , s	really	R	PREVB	tp
. You know , and it was- it was really stressful , but I love learning	really	R	PREJJ	tp
I can't remember . < ts > nobody really encouraged me to go to college	really	R	PREVB	tp
k to that . I'm still thinking . Really ? You see it all the time ? I do	really	R	POSTVB	tp
go to college , but my parents really couldn't afford it . And so I d	really	R	PREVB	tp
at all , I don't think . But , I really didn't see too many of ' em . Um	really	R	PREVB	tp
t I wanted to do , and I didn't really know , so I waited til the last	really	R	PREVB	tp
ntistry , but I don't think I'd really like to be a dentist . Too much	really	R	PREVB	tp

n . Senior year was fun , like I really- I was going out a good bit in	really	R	PREVB	tp

I took that job at < work > . Um , really high GPA , but my parents didn '	really	R	NPAM	tp
t do you call it ? I'm not a m- really a music person . It's on the ke	really	R	POSTVB	tp
best to get away cause he was really scared for th- for several rea	really	R	PREJJ	tp

e things and was like , I could really die right here , somebody could	really	R	PREVB	tp
ember . Uh- < ts > Gee , n- I r- I really couldn't uh , say who I thought	really	R	PREVB	tp
m- my best teacher was really . Uh , Mm , uh , well I remember u	really	R	POSTVB	tp
io , if you ain't really hearing niggas that sound like	really	R	PREVB	tp

t uh far as go like someone is really- a boy is really that dumb in	really	R	POSTVB	tp
kids to me . < laugh > You know I really didn't have too much to say wi	really	R	PREVB	tp

stop and you go , wow . That was really racist . Like , you didn't get-	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ose Sea Coast Islands and just really being caught up in the beauty	really	R	PREVB	tp
ou that feeling like you can't really trust what's going on around y	really	R	PREVB	tp
r club . But when I was a kid I really thought it was like the adviso	really	R	PREVB	tp
it was that stressful . I really didn't think that the staff di	really	R	PREVB	tp
ds in general , cause it can be really stressful , so . I didn't think	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ne that tell the parents , they really are in the program , you can ca	really	R	PREVB	tp
re at the club so late are you really doing X Y and Z ? And now we- I	really	R	PREVB	tp
? And then some of the stuff I really did used to do , but I can't te	really	R	PREVB	tp
n when I was younger . Cause we really just- we came to the club , we	really	R	PREVB	tp
younger kids a lot so I didn't really know how the programming and e	really	R	PREVB	tp
they're like , no you didn't . I really did , and it was fun . So . That	really	R	PREVB	tp
then I had never got to like , really go out of state without my fam	really	R	PREVB	tp
e all close cause our school's really small . So we started that , and	really	R	PREJJ	tp
poem with the kids , they were really shocked . I just write it and k	really	R	PREJJ	tp
rite poetry , so me and her got really close . So we're- even to this	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ou at lunch time . So she was a really good teacher . But in middle sc	really	R	NPAM	tp
rom high school . Cause she was really good at teaching math , I don't	really	R	PREJJ	tp
le don't know that , but that's really how it is . < ts > So I didn't ge	really	R	POSTVB	tp
rents to remove you . Which was really they were putting you out , but	really	R	POSTVB	tp
e , PhD's and everything , so it really prepared you for like life ski	really	R	PREVB	tp
y've growing up , and I just- I really could see myself visiting Sout	really	R	PREVB	tp
to South Carolina . Um , but I'm really interested in Geechee and Gull	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ell , they showed how much they really like him . While- When he was u	really	R	PREVB	tp
I mean , Clyde , he didn't wanna really kill nobody unless he was forc	really	R	PREVB	tp

guidance counselor who wasn't really , um , engaged . And at that time	really	R	PREJJ	tp
u know , people like , oh you're really smart and all . But there was n	really	R	PREJJ	tp
so , because of that , I didn't really lean on ohms as much as some s	really	R	PREVB	tp
those things where kid didn't really notice until , either A , he wen	really	R	PREVB	tp
t certain things , but I didn't really- I wa- I was never around them	really	R	PREVB	tp
s that bad , I'm like , that's a really good daycare , like I know some	really	R	NPAM	tp
s is my neighborhood like , she really thought- Cause I didn't think	really	R	PREVB	tp
urse H Street back then looked really run down , it was like nobo- it	really	R	PREJJ	tp
is area on this side has never really had anything like that . So it '	really	R	PREVB	tp
n . That's the only time that I really like to go out do stuff . I thi	really	R	PREVB	tp
to go . But I'm a homebody so I really don't like to go out that much	really	R	PREVB	tp

ousins . And , um , it just- I've really a lot of fond memories about ,	really	R	POSTVB	tp
gh > And so I mean , you know , I really feel that it's impossible beca	really	R	PREVB	tp
ted States . And , the part that really impressed me was how he was ab	really	R	PREVB	tp
n , because uh actually , if you really look at it , it gives you a edu	really	R	PREVB	tp
y I don't even have the chance really to watch it , you know ? Since m	really	R	POSTVB	tp
gave other teachers . And so I really think it r- falls on their per	really	R	PREVB	tp
now that I do teach , I have a really good , uh , writing , uh , mentor .	really	R	NPAM	tp
t of film or maybe a play . But really just immersing them into stori	really	R	PREVB	tp
chers had . I mean guys who was really bad , who wouldn't listen . But	really	R	PREJJ	tp
such and such . And I've never really met these people , but they fee	really	R	PREVB	tp
hing you know ? But some of ' em really have to be cruel towards some	really	R	PREVB	tp
I say this , uh , for ' em : they really feel like they doing the right	really	R	PREVB	tp
ed in , you know , and you know , really putting theirself out with ' em	really	R	PREVB	tp
. If I- i- if someone has a- a really good meal or has a pretty colo	really	R	NPAM	tp
ey tore my street down . Like I really ( laughing ) was traumatized , an	really	R	PREVB	tp
were playing with me , but they really running away from me . But < lau	really	R	PREVB	tp
. You see a lot of people just really staying in East Hills . Um . We	really	R	PREVB	tp
for me instead of worse . And I really think highly of her for that .	really	R	PREVB	tp
then and see her . Um no , she's really no contest really . Another one	really	R	POSTVB	tp
s particular that everyone was really crazy about . Yes . And that was	really	R	PREJJ	tp
you home to your parents . She really was . < laugh > No , it wasn't . No	really	R	PREVB	tp
ory . The basic things that you really study in school , you know . Sen	really	R	PREVB	tp
time . And you have to really show the dog that you really l	really	R	PREVB	tp
ore . < laugh > < laugh > You gotta really spend time with ' em , all your	really	R	PREVB	tp
y and you learning , and if you really interested in it , you can get	really	R	PREJJ	tp
uld sing , but we had this like really dramatic , uh , music teacher . A	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ct . Yes . Yup . Okay , when I was really small , from what I'm told , we	really	R	PREJJ	tp
of stuff , yeah . And I've never really experienced racism being with	really	R	PREVB	tp
elementary school , you didn't really have to say cause obviously yo	really	R	PREVB	tp
ty or something . Well , I can't really remember . < laugh > The- Um , tel	really	R	PREVB	tp
a Southern accent . I was like , really ? ( laughing ) Mm-hm . A lot of pe	really	R	POSTVB	tp
t's like Rochester . He's like , really ? Oh . Like , even from Rochester	really	R	POSTVB	tp
e from New York . They're like , really ? ( laughing ) < laugh > Really ? I	really	R	POSTVB	tp
d my money up front . Yeah . Not really . My mom ? She was born like , ba	really	R	POSTVB	tp
< ts > I mean like , < ts > I don't really claim neighborhoods like that ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
hm . Yeah , I don't think it- it really is , like I lived in Greece for	really	R	PREVB	tp
ation was BS . They didn't even really show you anything . They showed	really	R	PREVB	tp
e out there then . That's how I really feel , like if you want your ki	really	R	PREVB	tp
d- and- and family rituals and really just strong , strong beliefs th	really	R	NPAM	tp
did our chores , and those are really Southern practices , and being	really	R	POSTVB	tp
I've always known how to cook really well , and you know we got up t	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ind of just have to p- stay up really late , wait for the last person	really	R	POSTVB	tp
t day , which one you came from really ? And so , she went to- um , she	really	R	POSTVB	tp
l , but never did sports , never really was interested in that . But al	really	R	PREJJ	tp
t aid , and I was always a r- a really good writer , so I did activiti	really	R	NPAM	tp
twelfth grade , and again , just really , um , I'm still in contact with	really	R	PREVB	tp
o you , she fine . You know , but really being conscious of being a men	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ty , and , um , yeah , so it was a really , really good neighborhood . Wel	really	R	NPAM	tp
ve taken something . But it was really , uh , a place where people know	really	R	POSTVB	tp
t everyone in the neighborhood really stuck together , and it was a-	really	R	PREVB	tp
I can afford . And they're both really good schools . Or I'm tryna be	really	R	NPAM	tp
art kid , so she was able to do really well in all the state tests an	really	R	POSTVB	tp
letely ignored the debt , but I really didn't know much about it or h	really	R	PREVB	tp
t of an adjustment . And then I really didn't like my roommate , uh , c	really	R	PREVB	tp
, so they were there . I didn't really- I associated with a few peopl	really	R	PREVB	tp
m and so- and I've always been really , you know , centered around my	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ou don't live there , you don't really notice it . But there's a lot o	really	R	PREVB	tp
ig ass global shadow . It's not really that big of a deal . I mean the	really	R	POSTVB	tp
power , and I know this sounds really cheesy , but we have a lot of p	really	R	PREJJ	tp
uh , read a book when he didn't really have uh , the source of light ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
f taught photographer . I don't really want to waste any money on cla	really	R	PREVB	tp
alk but , at the same time , I'm really just kicking back and seeing w	really	R	PREVB	tp
I mean ? Like , I don't I don't really know what I wanna do . That's-	really	R	PREVB	tp
what I wanna do and i- I can't really fathom . So , working on that . Y	really	R	PREVB	tp
t . Like , I'm like , eh , I don't really know if I wanna do that anymor	really	R	PREVB	tp
y a tough season . But , I don't really get too much into the NFL eith	really	R	PREVB	tp
ime she was my fiancee , and it really got next to me . And then uh , i	really	R	PREVB	tp
me at Mom and Dad's , you know , really , and at that Christmas they ga	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ey gave me those things , which really shocked me cause I really wasn	really	R	PREVB	tp
hat . You know ? And I mean they really seemed like my parents . Right	really	R	PREVB	tp
ing , you know ? And most people really think he's my little brother ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
ng like that , no . Because um I really was never around the type of e	really	R	PREVB	tp
re I might feel like something really happened to me . And that's all	really	R	PREVB	tp
e time in my life , boy you can really have it . This one thing I did	really	R	PREVB	tp
g for awhile , you know ? But it really shocked me that I really could	really	R	PREVB	tp
xt year . So , the next year , we really on JV . If that makes sense . Ye	really	R	POSTVB	tp
play with the varsity . But we really , we just being like another JD	really	R	PREVB	tp
et to weightlifting with JV to really varsity people because I remem	really	R	POSTVB	tp
d say girlfriend , but we ain't really . Ya- You know . Difference betw	really	R	POSTVB	tp
idn't know how to make friends really . It was just like we- it was d	really	R	POSTVB	tp
And my mom was like , we can't really s- keep paying this . Then , we	really	R	PREVB	tp
ized that like other- I didn't really get along with certain people .	really	R	PREVB	tp
il about fifth grade . That was really like . ?? put it It was when I	really	R	POSTVB	tp
second grade teachers were all really nice . Ms. - I'd say- wait . Ms.	really	R	PREVB	tp
real nice . Yes . Yes . She was a really nice- And then , my second grad	really	R	NPAM	tp
nds- sounds incredible . But it really was true though . And if you co	really	R	PREJJ	tp
uiet , you know ? And I guess it really is my nerves you know ? I just	really	R	PREVB	tp
down blase , and you know ? I'm really not interested in that because	really	R	PREJJ	tp
always so funny . And I wasn't really- it was just something so I wo	really	R	POSTVB	tp
rban in Spencerport is , do you really wanna change the kids lives th	really	R	PREVB	tp
everything , you know , because really I can't say what you call a ro	really	R	PREVB	tp
ecause my life was pretty easy really . < laugh > To be honest with you	really	R	POSTJJ	tp
, because my father and mother really broke they neck to try get me	really	R	PREVB	tp
er- you know , so- So those are really important things that you have	really	R	NPAM	tp
each the other stuff . So , it's really frustrating that you can't get	really	R	PREJJ	tp
m- That's one thing I liked . I really liked it . And um , the lady who	really	R	PREVB	tp
ut , m- like , I remember my mom really kind of made it look way bette	really	R	PREVB	tp
ou know , when you uh- when you really didn't- you c- didn't care any	really	R	PREVB	tp
- on a- a first level but just really , you know , so I- it's good stu	really	R	PREVB	tp
folks , you know , more- I don't really think that black folks really	really	R	PREVB	tp
and my brother things we really wanted . You know , until my tas	really	R	PREVB	tp
that a lot of states don't . We really do . Um , and so , if you don't k	really	R	PREVB	tp
, from what I remember , it was really me and my grandma from when I	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ces . Um , and I think he does a really good job of taking people wher	really	R	NPAM	tp
y don't even realize , it isn't really geared toward me , or my intere	really	R	PREVB	tp
o much going on . Um , you can't really relax , um , but I obviously don	really	R	PREVB	tp
my whole life . But I think it really- and she tells me all the time	really	R	PREVB	tp
r almost five years , but we we really believe in trying to keep our	really	R	PREVB	tp
le ground right now , who can't really explain what's going on , but i	really	R	PREVB	tp
that's what the investment is really intended for . < laugh > Yeah . So	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ion but whatever . Um , but just really I like the n- I like neighborh	really	R	PREVB	tp
t a certificate . So um , I have really good penmanship because we had	really	R	NPAM	tp
lse do we do here that I don't really see nobody else doing ? I don't	really	R	PREVB	tp
It's a beautiful city . It's a really beautiful city , and now it suc	really	R	NPAM	tp
ything . I don't , but okay . Not really .	really	R	POSTVB	tp
eah . That was- I've always had really good mentors , but not for writ	really	R	NPAM	tp
e this particular type of like really creative-style , really skilled	really	R	NPAM	tp
g quotation mark- the norm , is really , the white . < laugh > And so , by	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ldosta . Okay . This how it was , really like , when we was in Florida ,	really	R	POSTVB	tp
Yeah . Mm-mm . Mm . Mm . Um . I was really back and forth with my grandma	really	R	POSTVB	tp
out and just- The only s- Not really . I feel like they have to get	really	R	POSTVB	tp
riend left . So I had nobody to really go with and the people that- t	really	R	PREVB	tp
started getting old enough to really take care of her , I was attach	really	R	PREVB	tp
he didn't say nothing , but she really didn't see me ! So I used to hi	really	R	PREVB	tp
f basketball , football . Well I really like it you know . Well I like	really	R	PREVB	tp
attack anybody if somebody was really gonna hurt me , you know . Well ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
you know . Actually , I think he really hated me because you know , I w	really	R	PREVB	tp
What's the difference ? I don't really think there is a big one , othe	really	R	PREVB	tp
school ideology and people not really realizing that what their gran	really	R	PREVB	tp
in Manhattan , so . ( laughing ) I really think it's just upbringing , ho	really	R	PREVB	tp
an indentured servant , I don't really know anybody that was born and	really	R	PREVB	tp
even saying white people . I'm really saying like English . I don't k	really	R	PREVB	tp
t new friends . So , they wasn't really coming down to the club . I did	really	R	PREVB	tp
l- involve me just chilling . I really don't- I'm not a club kind of	really	R	PREVB	tp
uing sometimes , and I couldn't really focus just in the house and li	really	R	PREVB	tp
person . I don't really feel the need or the urge to g	really	R	PREVB	tp
up with m- trees and grass and really nice houses . Yes . Yes . Absolut	really	R	NPAM	tp
re or there ? Um , See I grew up really rough , so the girls that I hun	really	R	PREJJ	tp
that . That's like w- we're not really playing hide and go seek , or t	really	R	PREVB	tp
tly boys , so it was like I was really- really didn't- I really wasn '	really	R	PREVB	tp
augh > Um . This . Well , it's not really locking . It's a two strand twi	really	R	PREVB	tp
now , you c- can't really generalize it either . I- I- mi	really	R	PREVB	tp
go there . Like the daycare was really good , you know . But hearing so	really	R	PREJJ	tp
did . I just loved doing it . It really wasn't nothing . I did not sign	really	R	PREVB	tp
tball , nothing like that . That really wasn't my thing . I just- my mo	really	R	PREVB	tp
joining a team , that was never really my thing . Only team that I joi	really	R	POSTVB	tp
layers type of person . I'm not really a team anymore . Like I'm glad	really	R	POSTVB	tp
player type . I'm not- I don't really like teams anymore . That's- ok	really	R	PREVB	tp
you know , grown people shit . I really don't do too much- too many cl	really	R	PREVB	tp
think the m- . One example that really stood out to me was , think it	really	R	PREVB	tp
y up and save it . So , I didn't really like uh , staying after hours a	really	R	PREVB	tp
gotten shot before , so I don't really see what the difference is , yo	really	R	PREVB	tp
illow ? Cause I like it . < ts > I really like Passport to Manhood , and	really	R	PREVB	tp
don't think anything like bad really went to my- went through my mi	really	R	PREVB	tp
. Yeah . Um . Um , rugby , I never really played it , myself . But , we've	really	R	PREVB	tp
lot of that too . Well , I don't really watch a lot of TV . Yeah . < laug	really	R	PREVB	tp
tuck because my parents didn't really know what to do , other than te	really	R	PREVB	tp
ge . So , I don't think < school > really prepared me for school . They j	really	R	PREVB	tp
tayed for our year . She didn't really check in with me . It was just	really	R	PREVB	tp
et with her , and then I didn't really see her again until the end wh	really	R	PREVB	tp
o . I just feel like they don't really advertise to the city schools	really	R	PREVB	tp
< ts > again , my parents didn't really speak anything other th- speak	really	R	PREVB	tp
to school , you know , nobody's really explaining how this works , a Q	really	R	PREVB	tp
now her , yeah she's- um , she's really , um , active in the community w	really	R	PREJJ	tp
e chance to go to China , which really kind of like- that's where my	really	R	PREVB	tp
So he was always open , 0 that really helped me just like , having a	really	R	PREVB	tp
come down here . It looks fun . Really ? I got to come down there toda	really	R	POSTVB	tp
lem . That's why I haven't , um , really kind of made the decision to m	really	R	PREVB	tp
but , um , Charlotte was cool . I really did enjoy Charlotte , so . That '	really	R	PREVB	tp
thing , but I'm not , that's not really my thing . Huh yeah . Yeah . Yeah	really	R	POSTVB	tp
cross the field like fa- like really fast , and he like literally pu	really	R	POSTVB	tp
the back of his gun . I didn't really , it didn't really bother me to	really	R	PREVB	tp
done or had go on that I don't really talk about . Like , I just . Is w	really	R	PREVB	tp
ke I'm bored here , and I don't really like being here , and so I'm al	really	R	PREVB	tp
ame , so if you- you can't even really- Cause race in that time obvio	really	R	PREVB	tp
at's- That was so- and I don't really know , just slight changes . We	really	R	PREVB	tp
e , lot of people I meet aren't really from here . Like , for example ,	really	R	POSTVB	tp
just riding my skateboard , not really doing anything uh , to get myse	really	R	PREVB	tp
t the whole day , which was uh , really good for me cause I took ' em t	really	R	PREJJ	tp
I didn't live then , so I can't really speak on that but obviously , y	really	R	PREVB	tp
rst . Mm . Not too much . I'm not really a basketball kind of guy . Like	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ms need a overhaul . It's- it's really sad . < ts > Now , I have a friend	really	R	PREJJ	tp
she would marry him cause she really was in love with him . So they	really	R	PREVB	tp
e real nigga shit , like if you really peep game , Donald Trump everyb	really	R	PREVB	tp
thirty , thirty-four . Like if I really wanna play it with my , you kno	really	R	PREVB	tp
names . Um , Daniel Caesar , he's really good . Maybe he's from Atlanta ,	really	R	PREJJ	tp
the bar . You know . We met- we really ain't officially meet the firs	really	R	PREVB	tp
limits . But I said that never really ain't never stopped me before .	really	R	PREVB	tp
. So , we looked at her , so you really want us to work ? Hell , I would	really	R	PREVB	tp
it . < laugh > You know , but you really tryna make us work , so we now	really	R	PREVB	tp
cute girls out of Valdosta . Or really the two two nine area up here ,	really	R	POSTVB	tp
cause I really never knew it was the two two	really	R	PREVB	tp
grab it . You know . Cause it's really no excuse , I mean . Other then	really	R	POSTVB	tp
d a small class anyway and she really just chipped in and put her ti	really	R	PREVB	tp
time then I- oh Cowboys . Oh I really did like that . We used to get	really	R	PREVB	tp
ay long . Oh yes , definitely . I really like er , uh- most movies I lik	really	R	PREVB	tp
me uh , Richard Kimble . Oh that really that- that's- there's a When t	really	R	PREVB	tp
the time now . The movie that I really think , a good Western that- th	really	R	PREVB	tp
ownloaded her last album . It's really different from her other ones .	really	R	PREJJ	tp
at I really liked I've- it's one I want to	really	R	PREVB	tp
m down and rode on , but it was really good movie . I never forget it .	really	R	NPAM	tp
That's the best western I've really seen in such a long time you k	really	R	PREVB	tp
now . Well I really can't say what's the be- but t	really	R	PREVB	tp
he runner , now I was- that was really trying just hearing the girls	really	R	PREVB	tp
teacher there , < name > . He was really something . He was really by th	really	R	POSTVB	tp
uh sessions you know . I didn't really like him and uh the Science cl	really	R	PREVB	tp
ther , stuff like that and uh I really did liked him because he was ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
a real lovable type guy and I really was interested in going to his	really	R	PREJJ	tp
of the type you know . She was really slick , and when she'd catch yo	really	R	PREJJ	tp
sic . Well I could- I won't say really master it , but like a little d	really	R	PREVB	tp

It was cancelled . Yeah . But I really feel bad . I wa- I was so depen	really	R	PREVB	tp
ome to their homes , it doesn't really matter as much . But , it seems	really	R	PREVB	tp
eighbors with how liberal they really are . You know , twenty dollar t	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ts at our school are . We don't really recognize as much as- Say at a	really	R	PREVB	tp

o I followed . Yeah . I- I don't really worry about it as much s- When	really	R	PREVB	tp
real quick ( laughing ) . I don't really worry about what's going to ha	really	R	PREVB	tp
Yes , very much so . I- I don't really feel as if- For instance , if I	really	R	PREVB	tp
was drafted , I'd- really I wouldn't want to go because	really	R	PREVB	tp
ther um , I don't know . I don't really care about dying , but if I had	really	R	PREVB	tp
ch one I'd do now . But I'm not really afraid of dying . I figure I'll	really	R	PREJJ	tp

Any special incident . No , not really . In junior high school or high	really	R	POSTVB	tp
You learn a lot of things , but really , it be a great job once you ge	really	R	PREVB	tp
s and stuff like that . Well , I really can't say uh- Oh , when we had	really	R	PREVB	tp

he Killing of Sister George is really concerned with uh uh the what	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ith the girls and so uh we- we really didn't bother about learning t	really	R	PREVB	tp
ust waiting . No we just didn't really bother with- we never really b	really	R	PREVB	tp
yes we did . Uh let's see , I- I really can't recall any of ' em one of	really	R	PREVB	tp
und thirteen or so did- did it really become distinguishable ab- abo	really	R	PREVB	tp
as goal post and um we had no really set patterns or plays we'd usu	really	R	NPAM	tp
her he was sorry but he didn't really know how . And uh , it was funny	really	R	PREVB	tp
now . But as a child , you don't really know what danger is , you know .	really	R	PREVB	tp
ues I guess you might say , not really knowing what they should be do	really	R	PREVB	tp
re the party was . < ts > No , not really . No . Plenty of them . Well , thi	really	R	POSTVB	tp
d on people . And uh , he didn't really holler at you but he'd ask you	really	R	PREVB	tp
on't like squares . Someone who really isn't aware what's going on . W	really	R	PREJJ	tp
you know . Uh I don't remember really . Maybe by a different name but	really	R	POSTVB	tp
d uh have to go into detail to really explain . Mm . Well I don't reme	really	R	PREVB	tp
d uh I- I remember them but it really would- I'd have to go into det	really	R	PREVB	tp
me to college . And uh , well I really never thought about going to c	really	R	PREVB	tp
on s- what a person say , don't really have to make you- you don't ha	really	R	PREVB	tp
ke , okay , like our project was really dangerous , but to us kids , it	really	R	PREJJ	tp
from a film world . They never really got the foundation of theater ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
, you know , like it . Go for it really .	really	R	POSTVB	tp
hing wrong so I knew I- it was really my fault so . Mm well , like thr	really	R	POSTVB	tp
h ceiling . And uh that was it , really < laugh > you know . Um They had	really	R	POSTVB	tp
those type of people . I didn't really pick up anybody from Atlanta y	really	R	PREVB	tp
yground . < laugh > Well it does , really . Now , what- L- looking at my c	really	R	POSTVB	tp
figure out anything that would really work . Um and they expanded his	really	R	PREVB	tp
son , whenever he- he would get really angry or concerned about uh , w	really	R	PREJJ	tp
that she was good , also . But I really for my own , I can't remember t	really	R	PREJJ	tp
teach whatsoever . She's- she's really uh pathetic , and I didn't enjo	really	R	PREJJ	tp
e lady history teacher who was really really short . She was under fi	really	R	PREJJ	tp
anish or French . Um I , I can't really say so . In some , in some cases	really	R	PREVB	tp
f the four of us though . Um , I really don't know we , we never enc- e	really	R	PREVB	tp
mean finish high school ? I , I really don't know . I would like to go	really	R	PREVB	tp
hough I think . Let's see . Um I really don't know . I guess I would bu	really	R	PREVB	tp
m no , I can't say I Um I can't really say that I've , that I have bee	really	R	PREVB	tp
sibility of , of uh hm . I can't really say that I , that I have . No si	really	R	PREVB	tp
things , um , quite a bit . I- I really don't think there's any such t	really	R	PREVB	tp
' m like oh my god , now I gotta really do this . I show up my first da	really	R	PREVB	tp
ey be amazed and love it so . I really wanna develop artists , you kno	really	R	PREVB	tp
call in , it gotta be something really , really serious . And people ju	really	R	PREJJ	tp
mean , at the hospital I don't really go- I- I haven't been through	really	R	PREVB	tp
me of these white people , they really think we're like , r- we would	really	R	PREVB	tp
like really like rob them and like rape th	really	R	PREVB	tp
os . I shoot mini films . It was really- it was really good to have th	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ld turn the other way . I don't really care , you know . Like , I'm cool	really	R	PREVB	tp
t black women r- I think they really running shit in Rochester . I-	really	R	PREVB	tp
I don't really hear too much shit people got	really	R	PREVB	tp
too . But I don't think it was really like meant to be said , but we	really	R	PREVB	tp
uff they say too . Mm . < ts > Not really . Like I- but like I always say	really	R	POSTVB	tp
nd stuff . Well everybody can't really make up their mind cause somet	really	R	PREVB	tp
en ? I don't know like- I don't really think so . I think- I think tha	really	R	PREVB	tp
fit in when- whenever we were really desperate for - for somebody t	really	R	PREJJ	tp
unities . k- I mean , you're not really mingling with the other- other	really	R	PREVB	tp
space . I- I don't li- I don't really enjoy crowds that much . To a c	really	R	PREVB	tp
That's- it's- it's deep . It's really deep , but yeah , that- the- whe	really	R	PREJJ	tp
of the fence . I've never done really volunteer work like that . And	really	R	POSTVB	tp
I just really wanted to do music , and what I	really	R	PREVB	tp
bit , just to figure out what I really wanted to do . Then I realized	really	R	PREVB	tp
h of other stuff happened that really got me lost in the sauce . I wa	really	R	PREVB	tp
, you know , moved me in , and I really got down to my major , it seeme	really	R	PREVB	tp
nth . Mm . < ts > Yeah , what- what really made me leave the military was	really	R	PREVB	tp
n't know . My teacher- I didn't really like my teacher that much . It	really	R	PREVB	tp
h probably so . < laugh > I can't really see any reason to change it . I	really	R	PREVB	tp
t wasn't really- It didn't seem to be anything	really	R	PREVB	tp
ve to deal with me . And nobody really wanted to deal with her , so th	really	R	PREVB	tp
. Let's see . What else did she really get mad about ? Uh , at the time	really	R	PREVB	tp
f kids I know , but we did some really you know , stupid things that s	really	R	NPAM	tp
s , you know , bah , and it never really change . But he had some way of	really	R	PREVB	tp
re- where I'm living at , it really- this one is really reminding	really	R	PREVB	tp
to write . Because at first , I really didn't- I thought I knew how t	really	R	PREVB	tp
ropping it this year . I didn't really want to continue it , but they	really	R	PREVB	tp
on't know . I was- This teacher really woke me up to it . She made me	really	R	PREVB	tp
d I've normally liked . I can't really think of one I didn't really l	really	R	PREVB	tp
n't think she'd be that stupid really . It- All you have to do is put	really	R	POSTJJ	tp
languages well . But , she never really displayed her talents with us .	really	R	PREVB	tp
kids I hung around with didn't really know how to associate with uh	really	R	PREVB	tp
t- most of the time , we didn't really think about it . It was just- T	really	R	PREVB	tp
you were the leader . We didn't really uh , associate any one person a	really	R	PREVB	tp
Unintelligible Well , we didn't really care that much about how big t	really	R	PREVB	tp
if they couldn't . So we didn't really think about it . I was always a	really	R	PREVB	tp
periority , but we d- we didn't really um , capitalize on that biggest	really	R	PREVB	tp
n . But I don't know . We didn't really push him that hard to do anyth	really	R	PREVB	tp
e weren't that many people who really wanted to uh , be a decent grou	really	R	PREVB	tp
gs have popped up that I don't really know about , and I'm really unc	really	R	PREVB	tp
up to a language that I hadn't really cared about . I was really thin	really	R	PREVB	tp
what I mean , you can't let it really like consume your whole outloo	really	R	PREVB	tp
n , I went from , mm , people not really knowing who I am , you know , pe	really	R	PREVB	tp
ue where they can do what they really feel like doing . You know what	really	R	PREVB	tp
head , and it's like , woah , he really said that . It didn't sound lik	really	R	PREVB	tp
verything's more open there . I really do . Seems like it . I started w	really	R	PREVB	tp
don't think I ever should have really , stayed this long here . So , ma	really	R	PREVB	tp
Like , It was literally like a really dysfunctional business , that's	really	R	NPAM	tp
selfless at all . But when you really feel like you don't want the o	really	R	PREVB	tp
back , eventually . It took w- a really long time , but I think if I kn	really	R	NPAM	tp
there's a whole world . So , I'm really hopeful , but at the same time ,	really	R	PREJJ	tp
w- within . And there are some really talented artists here . And- an	really	R	NPAM	tp
fact that I can like , split a really nice brand new three bedroom w	really	R	NPAM	tp
g with my boyfriend , like it's really nice . You can like , make a hom	really	R	PREJJ	tp
sn't have to be a struggle . It really doesn't . Even if it means that	really	R	PREVB	tp
te this city . And I think it's really great for people who are at a	really	R	PREJJ	tp
le things can happen to you in really beautiful places so , um , I thi	really	R	NPAM	tp
though , sometimes and I don't really have cause to drive down there	really	R	PREVB	tp
ildings . And it just- it looks really nice and I don't know if it- t	really	R	PREJJ	tp
d the worst area . So , that was really nice , but I would say those ar	really	R	PREJJ	tp
g . So that's why this is like , really , really deep for me , actually	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ng . So , yeah , that's when they really started going to shows . They o	really	R	PREVB	tp
doing this . Years later , now I really understand music , and I unders	really	R	PREVB	tp
< laugh > It's har- it's hard to really explain it , but yeah . It all s	really	R	PREVB	tp
play , I would say nowadays , it really doesn't matter . It d- matters	really	R	PREVB	tp
tacking the profession and you really grind hard to do what you do ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
nsorts about it , but I haven't really got any definite plans or have	really	R	PREVB	tp
her a little bit . But I tried really hard to like have the newscast	really	R	POSTVB	tp
s like an echo of it . It's not really the real thing . And um , people	really	R	POSTVB	tp
o- a Rochester t-shirt . And it really is a dope t-shirt . I kind of w	really	R	PREVB	tp
e I determined from when I was really young , not to have one . I- so	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ut yeah I like this area . It's really comfortable and nice . I feel l	really	R	PREJJ	tp
re . It's just these houses are really nice . Like there are some beau	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ome . Obviously , like somewhere really nice . I'd want a really nice h	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ster , I say Rochester . I don't really know why , but I do . Maybe I tr	really	R	PREVB	tp
I have no question in my mind really . The only question ( laughing )	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ng on lately , I l- like to see really , what it would be like for me	really	R	POSTVB	tp
It would kind of give me- not really power , but I couldn't really s	really	R	POSTVB	tp
g we not thankful , but it just really just let you know that god is	really	R	PREVB	tp
hat position and it worked out really well . It- it really did . So , I	really	R	POSTVB	tp
. I had it . But in the end , he really was proud that he had a daught	really	R	PREJJ	tp
half years , we just- We didn't really decide , cause I don't think at	really	R	PREVB	tp
staurant that had- only whites really went there . And if- if you wer	really	R	PREVB	tp
dious . It was very- uh , it was really a headache . It was crazy from	really	R	POSTVB	tp
t's the way I feel . Yes . No , I really don't . Because I- We don't kno	really	R	PREVB	tp
in the United States . That was really luck . When I was in the Servic	really	R	POSTVB	tp
her teachers that I've had . It really is . Oh- uh- Oh yes . Oh yes . We	really	R	PREVB	tp
of all those stars , but it was really good . I really enjoyed Gone wi	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ose stars but I think that was really good . No , I don't watch an- an	really	R	PREJJ	tp
of- when they came back , they really didn't have no identity , with	really	R	PREVB	tp
the kids , the kids really didn't know who they was , and	really	R	PREVB	tp
future working . I- I was never really interested in it , no . Well , I	really	R	PREJJ	tp
e one- the only teacher that I really objected to was a male teacher	really	R	PREVB	tp
name of that class , but it was really fun . The teacher was really go	really	R	PREJJ	tp
er his name though . That was a really good class . What'd they call t	really	R	NPAM	tp
ts to be built , mm-hm . Mm . Not really . Cau- cause I mean , we just do	really	R	POSTVB	tp
at else he did . But , you never really seen him . We basically on our	really	R	PREVB	tp
and with my background , it it really wasn't that big of a deal with	really	R	PREVB	tp
ime . Full year , I mean and you really can't blame the kid , because t	really	R	PREVB	tp
t . < laugh > I really didn't like school . Like , I gu	really	R	PREVB	tp
what color you is . < laugh > Not really . Cause I just wanted to get ou	really	R	POSTVB	tp
g us through . Um , we have been really blessed over the last three or	really	R	PREJJ	tp
. You know cause I do one , really . stunting that you know , it's	really	R	POSTVB	tp
It's like a six L A C K . He's really good . I like , um , this girl ca	really	R	PREJJ	tp
up y'all dialect . Like I don't really hang out with Atlanta people l	really	R	PREVB	tp
ust stayed to myself . I didn't really do anything extracurricular in	really	R	PREVB	tp
t know . And then , um , I wasn't really into like , cheerleading becaus	really	R	POSTVB	tp
r ? Something like that , yeah I really liked that . And then I took dr	really	R	PREVB	tp
You know . But , at that time , I really didn't know racism as I do now	really	R	PREVB	tp
rt conditions . And n- he never really fully s- committed to doing tr	really	R	PREVB	tp
t in the suburbs . Mm . We don't really celebrate any holidays , but Ch	really	R	PREVB	tp
ct when she needs to act . I- I really think so . Um , so , I think she	really	R	PREVB	tp
uh , James Brown . He's- I don't really like him that much though . I d	really	R	PREVB	tp
e the only way I think anybody really be recognized completely as ha	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ep in all these things because really unfortunately , I- I wanted- I	really	R	PREVB	tp
rk with some of my people , who really- you kn- who are- were in this	really	R	PREVB	tp
brought up in a sheltered life really compared- I- I'm not as bad as	really	R	PREVB	tp
ms here and there . And I don't really- I couldn't really say what I '	really	R	PREVB	tp
ome together , and I see what I really want because right now I don't	really	R	PREVB	tp
really know . But , with this political	really	R	PREVB	tp
group of boys- th- they aren't really- they're- they're far from poo	really	R	PREVB	tp
imes , but not very many people really realize what little- how littl	really	R	PREVB	tp
Twelve kids in the place . Not really much to lose , like the poor pe	really	R	POSTVB	tp
a month , that's not that much really , but it's enough to do better	really	R	POSTVB	tp
about , something probably they really ain't going to have no control	really	R	PREVB	tp
nna do . Um , and really pretty much kind of got some g	really	R	POSTVB	tp
the indicators of whether they really are serious about what they wa	really	R	PREJJ	tp
that one child out there that really wants to change . And so , I don	really	R	PREVB	tp
d it's and it's real sad . It's really sad because even when you pour	really	R	PREJJ	tp
gonna be okay . I really do . Oh lord , I have a new gran	really	R	PREVB	tp
t birthdays I ever had . It- it really was . And actually I think that	really	R	PREVB	tp
have , I don't think I ever had really had a birthday party . In fact	really	R	PREVB	tp
omething like that , but didn't really have no birthday party . Not- n	really	R	PREVB	tp
grand saved back so I can just really- Uh , who graduating ? Oh , ho , y	really	R	PREVB	tp
ecause I had a teacher that he really used to push me a lot . And lik	really	R	PREVB	tp
osta do as a grandparent . I- I really do as far as cause I want her	really	R	PREVB	tp
t know . Your whole- this seems really interesting . And I definitely	really	R	PREJJ	tp
a- a Rochester thing . I don't really know if I count though , cause	really	R	PREVB	tp
o , maybe you'll find it . And I really hope you don't find it on this	really	R	PREVB	tp
atter , and second of all , if I really think about it I guess it's li	really	R	PREVB	tp
one . Um , I'm trying to- One I really like is- I like quite a few . I	really	R	PREVB	tp
got on top , the father wasn't really there . He was absent father , b	really	R	POSTVB	tp
I really tried , really really hard to modify my speech befor	really	R	PREJJ	tp
cially basketball . Um , I still really enjoy cartoons . < laugh > Um uh	really	R	PREVB	tp
m , comic book characters . I- I really find these interesting . Oh lik	really	R	PREVB	tp
of them . Oh um , uh it's- it's really hard like it- it depends on th	really	R	PREJJ	tp
his is . But growing up , it was really just like , I don't know . Like	really	R	POSTVB	tp
body , and- and doing that , and really like understanding like I don '	really	R	PREVB	tp
g that . Um , but again , I never really- never really thought about it	really	R	PREVB	tp
ke , one , how strong I was , and really like my resilience . Like , so ,	really	R	POSTVB	tp
if I didn't have that , I don't really know where I would be right no	really	R	PREVB	tp
different , because she didn't really understand how much I had matu	really	R	PREVB	tp
happened to me , and I couldn't really explain it to her . Um , and the	really	R	PREVB	tp
this area , this I can say , is really like , the first time I moved a	really	R	POSTVB	tp
living was nice and then , uh , really what ended up happening was th	really	R	PREVB	tp
ed off of < address > , which was really quiet . I realized that I like	really	R	PREJJ	tp
< address > a lot . < address > is really a nice place . Um , even- even l	really	R	POSTVB	tp
t's kind of like- I think it's really more like- like- like manneris	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ay . I started realizing that's really just a mentality . Like , it's l	really	R	POSTVB	tp
play in the yard . Um , I guess , really my only issue there was like ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
n the end , it ended up getting really bad , but , uh , went in and basi	really	R	PREJJ	tp
g portrayed to be divided , but really , everybody knows somebody in s	really	R	PREVB	tp
nity , you start realizing that really really quick like , oh you know	really	R	POSTVB	tp
uy . Um , and I decided to do it really because like , the other class	really	R	POSTVB	tp
was really just , so boring . And then I ge	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ht . What I liked about that is really even though the work- I mean ,	really	R	POSTVB	tp
I- it still wasn't really that much more challenging for	really	R	PREJJ	tp
philosophy , but didn't end up really working out too well . Um , I re	really	R	PREVB	tp
igh school- the high school is really where I would say I thrived , b	really	R	POSTVB	tp
leventh grade year , I ended up really like , diving into like still l	really	R	PREVB	tp
ctually in school . So I got to really really dive into like my inter	really	R	PREVB	tp
Uh , I don't know . < school > is really- like I said , it was really ba	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ay so first , you know , I'm not really learning nothing because I'm n	really	R	PREVB	tp
k and correct it . They weren't really like , you need to have the rig	really	R	POSTVB	tp
e different senior committees , really , so you kno- understand and kn	really	R	POSTVB	tp
those type of differences . Not really , judging or anything . It's jus	really	R	PREVB	tp
around like , the ideal time to really have kids . But um , realizing t	really	R	PREVB	tp
d a light in seeing seeing um , really like the age difference . Start	really	R	POSTVB	tp
to find out , the bandit hadn't really taken her . She wanted to go . S	really	R	PREVB	tp
e came in on the scene , and he really produced . He showed that he wa	really	R	PREVB	tp
n those days when the west was really like that it seemed crazy for	really	R	POSTVB	tp
hat this man was really together with this fella by be	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ter time , but- I really thought that uh , well I knew t	really	R	PREVB	tp
but I can't give you the date really because it was back in the win	really	R	POSTVB	tp
' d yell at me for that . No not really because uh , when she did yell	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ith the kids . And she made you really work . You know you- you found	really	R	PREVB	tp
d poetry to the class . So I- I really enjoyed that . Uh , this was my	really	R	PREVB	tp
en anything like that . She was really something . Yeah she did that .	really	R	POSTVB	tp
> Well- Well there's two girls really , Veronica and another friend o	really	R	POSTVB	tp
a has a way about her , nothing really gets her down but so much you	really	R	PREVB	tp
ite a uh , traumatic experience really you know when you're getting h	really	R	POSTVB	tp
. And in high school I found I really had an interest for it and the	really	R	PREVB	tp
have a job when I can get one really . < laugh > Well we're usually to	really	R	POSTVB	tp
bout on it's last legs . No not really die as such where I'd be dead ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
up over there was just kind of really- it was childhood . Like , you g	really	R	POSTVB	tp
s and I was able to understand really what she was talking about , an	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ealing the test papers and not really using them , just burning ' em u	really	R	PREVB	tp
And they would- they would uh , really call them leaders because the	really	R	PREVB	tp
me to watch her . So , it's not really as bad , you know , as it would	really	R	PREJJ	tp
transportation , but I wouldn't really you know , try to spend it all ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
t's like , okay , I know I don't really feel like waking up on Sunday	really	R	PREVB	tp
places that I think they could really use here . I think that if it w	really	R	PREVB	tp
hristmas Eve , and you couldn't really sleep on Christmas day ( laughi	really	R	PREVB	tp
ifteen years old , and I didn't really know what to think . I wasn't h	really	R	PREVB	tp
cumstances made me feel like I really wanted to be dead because I wa	really	R	PREVB	tp
out , you know . And then it had really jarred me because my head was	really	R	PREVB	tp
upset . I don't really know . Sometime the next day . N	really	R	PREVB	tp
redict what's going to happen , really . Well I think that we can make	really	R	POSTVB	tp
hen I got the bicycle I didn't really want it . But after I grew up ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
kily like senior year I didn't really have much classes because I ha	really	R	PREVB	tp
that like relax time and focus really just on my project , but still ,	really	R	POSTVB	tp
little bit . And I guess it was really just making sure that I'm just	really	R	PREVB	tp
ng gunned down across America , really for no apparent reason . And th	really	R	POSTVB	tp
it still doesn't deter me from really wanting my city to be prospero	really	R	PREVB	tp
us and really understanding that like , again	really	R	PREVB	tp
potential . Right now , I don't really know how to feel because a lot	really	R	PREVB	tp
it took me about two years to really you know , catch on to what she	really	R	PREVB	tp
say everything cause it didn't really matter long as she could open	really	R	PREVB	tp
me , or else she just wanted to really take it out on the other child	really	R	PREVB	tp
. But nowadays , the kids don't really care , I don't think . I had a t	really	R	PREVB	tp
mber which ones I've seen that really impressed me cause usually , wh	really	R	PREVB	tp
ed . And uh , she was a gem . She really was . She was- sh- < laugh > Well	really	R	PREVB	tp
a beautiful woman , and she was really interested in the children . So	really	R	PREJJ	tp
iking school until high school really . And um , I just found that who	really	R	POSTVB	tp
age in the eighth grade , but I really got into it in high school . An	really	R	PREVB	tp
d uh , I really enjoyed it . I took Spanish . An	really	R	PREVB	tp
t progressive . < laugh > No . Not really . I uh , I have several circles	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ght or wrong . So I- I- I don't really know why , but that- that's jus	really	R	PREVB	tp
s far as I was concerned , they really didn't have to do anything exc	really	R	PREVB	tp
idn't get him either . But they really gave him merry chase but , and	really	R	PREVB	tp
rybody , I hope < laugh > . It was really weird , you know < laugh > . Um . N	really	R	PREJJ	tp
- Pretty good . Not bad . Not to really um < laugh > Well I uh , always l	really	R	PREVB	tp
on to the next . Mm-hm . Mm , not really I had one , well I guess you co	really	R	POSTVB	tp
akes no difference . No . Yes . I really don't believe in it . < laugh > N	really	R	PREVB	tp
cture was very good . I mean it really had a good point to it . And th	really	R	PREVB	tp
of it , I don't think will ever really change . Um , because , again , li	really	R	PREVB	tp
here because all they did they really hurt themselves . And then if-	really	R	PREVB	tp
Oh , over there ? Well I have a really soft voice anyway you know < la	really	R	NPAM	tp
l somebody about it so uh he's really find a hard time . He keeps pes	really	R	PREVB	tp
acks the best . < laugh > No , not really . I just like to sit down like	really	R	POSTVB	tp
a little divided on this point really because in a sense I believe i	really	R	POSTVB	tp
them really impressed me that much . Yeah ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
mas present that I ever got . I really can't remember . Maybe none of	really	R	PREVB	tp
to me , I really- from what I heard on the radi	really	R	PREVB	tp
ts are small people I h- I had really never seen anyone so big . And	really	R	PREVB	tp
' m like- And in this moment , I really don't know what to do . I don't	really	R	PREVB	tp
' s what I'm gonna do . And it's really a- a- a conscious choice . Like	really	R	POSTVB	tp
l > and going into college , and really the real world , cause when I w	really	R	POSTVB	tp
I was also at that time , like really working and supporting myself .	really	R	PREVB	tp
' m just like , um , no , it's not really how it works . And everybody's	really	R	POSTVB	tp
was like , no like , yes that's really how it is . Like cause she like	really	R	POSTVB	tp
with privileged kids who never really faced any adversity . Who never	really	R	PREVB	tp
really s- s- had to deal with anyone	really	R	PREVB	tp
ke , that's too much . I'm like , really ? You sure ? I- I- just- I feel	really	R	POSTVB	tp
took me outside of myself and really learning about other people . U	really	R	PREVB	tp
f how to do that , um , but also really pushing me and encouraging me	really	R	PREVB	tp
me to talk to him ? So I don't really know how you guys feel about m	really	R	PREVB	tp
e . I don't really know how to feel about that . U	really	R	PREVB	tp
nt me to talk to you , and they really want you to join their program	really	R	PREVB	tp
llow me to work in schools and really get to work with the community	really	R	PREVB	tp
. And I'm like , cool . And that really started like , me getting into	really	R	PREVB	tp
from < work > and- and- and just really like again , taking advantage o	really	R	PREVB	tp
t- it was- it was nice , it was really nice . But I was really looking	really	R	PREJJ	tp
this is how I feel like I can really make some type of impact or ch	really	R	PREVB	tp
tled to our own goals and it's really just- it- it really drove me t	really	R	POSTVB	tp
can't ignore this , but I- it's really just- it doesn't- it doesn't d	really	R	POSTVB	tp
o like , I guess I never- never really thought about it . I'm still wa	really	R	PREVB	tp
I guess the real reason why I really wanna just travel is to like ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
on't really know how to do it . I don't kno	really	R	PREVB	tp
nna- I wanna do something that really like , plays into that . Um , I d	really	R	PREVB	tp
e to lock me up . I'm like , you really just looked for any reason to	really	R	PREVB	tp
acuse , Buffalo , Rochester . But really like , pouring into local artis	really	R	PREVB	tp
time is where I started like , really being like , yo Rochester is re	really	R	PREVB	tp
open mic , and you see concert- really concert level talent . I've bee	really	R	POSTVB	tp
n , again with rock bottom , um , really just , doing a lot of different	really	R	PREVB	tp
d < work > , and anywhere I could really teach . So at that point , I bec	really	R	PREVB	tp
but with the youth , we started really just I guess , making a loud no	really	R	POSTVB	tp
, and I think that- like , that really started like , kick-starting- i	really	R	PREVB	tp
' s not- that's not the way . So really just starting to really like ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
was too much of a little lady really . < laugh > < ts > Well when I went	really	R	POSTVB	tp
know , I think I needed Mott to really um , show me both sides you kno	really	R	PREVB	tp
go . So they rode off . So they really hijacked the train . They made	really	R	PREVB	tp
ght that was interesting cause really we know less about our under-	really	R	PREVB	tp
eacher and um thi- this hasn't really been any real- really great in	really	R	PREVB	tp
n my present situation now I'm really lost because I'm in a predomin	really	R	PREJJ	tp
t- I'm sort of lost I- I can't really relate to my neighborhood , my	really	R	PREVB	tp
y friends anymore , and I don't really fit in in this totally white e	really	R	PREVB	tp
Um . No there again um I wasn't really associated with one particular	really	R	PREJJ	tp
e other three boys that I r- I really grew up with and that I was re	really	R	PREVB	tp
. Well , < laugh > um uh not- not really , um when we got into the Scout	really	R	POSTVB	tp
- the l- the leadership wasn't really accepted . Not until later on .	really	R	PREJJ	tp
to Gordon and um , I was- I was really surprised I- I really didn't k	really	R	PREJJ	tp
nds . A lot of people who I can really talk to , a lot of people who I	really	R	PREVB	tp
ys later , < laugh > the food was really smelly . Yes . < laugh > Oh boy ! <	really	R	PREJJ	tp
wledge , I don't think so . Well really , I don't know . I- I really cou	really	R	PREVB	tp
til we got tired . No . We ain't really have to say not it real quickl	really	R	PREVB	tp
( laughing ) to think of . Um , I really can't think of any more . Not-	really	R	PREVB	tp
d um , they thought that he was really being effected by uh- by the u	really	R	PREVB	tp
. No . It's my interests . Well , really I don't think that um , that wa	really	R	PREVB	tp
I think around that time . Not really . Not really . Mm-mm . Um , < exhal	really	R	POSTVB	tp
yeah . That's all I r- remember really , but , um , I remember leaving t	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ttle bit at peace . You know , I really- honestly I felt like I didn't	really	R	PREVB	tp
ers for a chain of stores . Not really . It sounds big . < laugh > Ah . Oo	really	R	POSTVB	tp
being anything professionally really . I uh , just wanted to uh , at t	really	R	POSTVB	tp
those childhood days , I've- I really started mixing . You know , goin	really	R	PREVB	tp
in about a week or so because really we haven't seen anything in th	really	R	PREVB	tp
uh- I feel that my freedom was really limited to um , < ts > I'll give	really	R	PREJJ	tp
until sixty five . Mm-hm . It is really intereseting . I mean you- you	really	R	PREJJ	tp
we break even . < laugh > Yeah . I really do . I really think we break ev	really	R	PREVB	tp
ing really did . I mean I- I knew I had to	really	R	PREVB	tp
an put my finger on it and can really tell you about it . Mm-mm . Noth	really	R	PREVB	tp
It's how well you grow it- You really can reach the point where you	really	R	PREVB	tp
intest idea . < laugh > I mean- I really think it depends on how well y	really	R	PREVB	tp
have uh- you really have something to keep you occ	really	R	PREVB	tp
and cheese at the time , it was really fun because she was also talki	really	R	PREJJ	tp
wasn't- My- my- The courses I really did the best in were Social Sc	really	R	PREVB	tp
was my French teacher , that I really had any trouble with . I don't	really	R	PREVB	tp
r Superman and there's nothing really particular that stands out as	really	R	PREJJ	tp
a- a really good show . I f- you know I jus	really	R	NPAM	tp
out the only thing that we can really agree on as far as watching TV	really	R	PREVB	tp
oth enjoy cartoons . Um nothing really because I- I watch a lot of th	really	R	POSTVB	tp
process of watching so nothing really sticks in my mind as an outsta	really	R	PREVB	tp
here's nothing about them that really lingers in my mind as being an	really	R	PREVB	tp
irst programs to come on . I- I really can't remember relate all the	really	R	PREVB	tp
y . Um a lot of the movies I- I really enjoy . Um Bridge on the River	really	R	PREVB	tp
ovies and at times I can never really- really call any- any particul	really	R	PREVB	tp
nd and say that this movie was really good and this one was really b	really	R	PREJJ	tp
re- a lot of the old movies I really despise because the dramatics	really	R	PREVB	tp
d this was a very good movie I really enjoyed it , yes . The New Inter	really	R	PREVB	tp

rought up , and um I- if it's a really good Western with someone real	really	R	NPAM	tp
- I'll sit down and I'll- I'll really watch it but again , there has	really	R	PREVB	tp
n of of eight . And um unless I really have some pressing work I'll g	really	R	PREVB	tp
homework when- when we w- are really pressed , and um at eight- eigh	really	R	PREJJ	tp
that's what made her a real- a really good teacher . Uh , when I was i	really	R	NPAM	tp
time was . And uh , they didn't really give a damn- < laugh > about uh ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
, I just don't worry about it , really , cause uh , my philosophy is if	really	R	POSTVB	tp
I wanted to go but I've never really been counsel- counseled by one	really	R	PREVB	tp
by a lot of teachers , um , I- I really can't say that there was one p	really	R	PREVB	tp
then when the baseball season really got under way , we'd go down to	really	R	PREVB	tp
- he tried and he- I don't- he really didn't understand what he was	really	R	PREVB	tp
ecause there have been several really good teachers I had a very goo	really	R	NPAM	tp
o was uh a real antagonist who really yelled a lot , made a lot of no	really	R	PREVB	tp
chers who I didn't think could really teach , but um I've put up with	really	R	PREVB	tp
nt most about it . Um no n- not really . Um I've never really had any	really	R	POSTVB	tp
no problem at all it's um not really that hard actually , it's a mat	really	R	PREVB	tp
be a good college . And if you really do your work and and do work t	really	R	PREVB	tp
od but haven't been able to be really outstanding teachers in the ey	really	R	NPAM	tp
n , um , I realized Rochester is really big . I mean , it's a small city	really	R	PREJJ	tp
efore I go to college . Um , I'm really interested in people and- < lau	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ere . So I really haven't decided yet where- wha	really	R	PREVB	tp
e of money . And desks , oh they really believed in holidays . You know	really	R	PREVB	tp
dn't been there . But my mother really believed in Christmas , she'd b	really	R	PREVB	tp
the things under the tree . We really cut up . < laugh > And uh , that m	really	R	PREVB	tp
ch correction . And I did and I really did enjoy it . But now that I'm	really	R	PREVB	tp
l of that time that she didn't really need to call my mother . And uh	really	R	PREVB	tp
ing in high school but nothing really that would you know qualify me	really	R	POSTVB	tp
een in a academic course Which really prepared me for college and no	really	R	PREVB	tp
k with deaf mutes , and I don't really think we were taught to work w	really	R	PREVB	tp
for San Sebastian , and it was really good . Uh , it was about this ma	really	R	PREJJ	tp
somebody else but they haven't really brought that fact out . No she '	really	R	PREVB	tp
id other things and so I never really became that interested in tele	really	R	PREVB	tp
different tricks . Oh yes I was really good . No it wasn't- it wasn't	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ns , uh , the- there wasn't that really mixing of , uh , uh , the races i	really	R	POSTVB	tp

my shop teacher uh , he doesn't really holler uh , no . He gets his poi	really	R	PREVB	tp
what's going on there . I'd be really interested i- in in working th	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ustry and stuff like that . You really couldn't- I never really got a	really	R	PREVB	tp
around the issues in terms of really understanding them . Uh , they'r	really	R	PREVB	tp
y're- you know , the people are really well acquainted with what's go	really	R	PREJJ	tp
- I wanna get out of it . And I really don't like it because I was in	really	R	PREVB	tp
crowded , I had a good time , I really felt good in public school , I	really	R	PREVB	tp
ike they would . But this isn't really what I want now and this is wh	really	R	POSTVB	tp
y back on those others who who really need my help . And so I- I real	really	R	PREVB	tp
nd you don't- as being black I really don't fit in like um you'd- on	really	R	PREVB	tp
aster is a bad time because we really don't have an Easter vacation	really	R	PREVB	tp
And it was a bad night , it was really dark and misty and rainy and t	really	R	PREJJ	tp
of the poor schools , they are really poor . They don't have running	really	R	PREJJ	tp
st too much . But that's what I really want to do . I wanna continue t	really	R	PREVB	tp

th ministry . Um , that's what I really wanna do . I really wanna give	really	R	PREVB	tp

e that . And so , uh , people was really shocked when she says she want	really	R	PREJJ	tp
States ? I think so , but blacks really didn't get anything out of , uh	really	R	PREVB	tp
then it means that we haven't really made the strives that was- wa-	really	R	PREVB	tp
rmist view that , uh , something really needs to be done about it . And	really	R	PREVB	tp
be very , very mobile and , uh , really not putting down a lot of root	really	R	PREVB	tp

whatever the case may be . So I really don't know . And I can't speak	really	R	PREVB	tp
e , couple weeks ago . I mean , I really don't know . I can't speak on s	really	R	PREVB	tp
ular costume , you're not gonna really know , like- You- you might see	really	R	PREVB	tp
nished for nothing they didn't really do . Or you know , see ' em get a	really	R	PREVB	tp
, you know- it's something you really wanna do- Like I say , he tell	really	R	PREVB	tp
uh , this year , it was me and- Really , We really planned it , you kno	really	R	PREVB	tp
p for the team , and I guess he really was a- better than the fifth m	really	R	PREVB	tp
l table . And I ain't- I didn't really think she was gonna buy that ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
in my current position , um , I really- I have a lot of fun , um , it's	really	R	PREVB	tp
t- I don't know . I can't say I really thought I might die , but I was	really	R	PREVB	tp
she's from- I mean she's don't really claim nothing but she's uh , Fo	really	R	PREVB	tp
the wrong people . That's why I really come down here to get away fro	really	R	PREVB	tp
own here I can talk to . That's really what my program is around like	really	R	POSTVB	tp
hing going on at home that you really don't wanna talk about then yo	really	R	PREVB	tp
ot like a bad kid . So I didn't really get into a lot of fights . I me	really	R	PREVB	tp
nt there one time , and I don't really- I mean I talk to them every n	really	R	PREVB	tp
arned how to do coding so that really got me interested in it . Oh ye	really	R	PREVB	tp
me is gonna be . And like I- I really can't see how to make all of t	really	R	PREVB	tp
ive the whole gamut because it really doesn't , you know , some p- it	really	R	PREVB	tp
nd care and stuff . So that was really awesome in that I feel like I '	really	R	PREJJ	tp
it was just the whole year was really a struggle . And they kept aski	really	R	POSTVB	tp
t more like family-like . Um , I really liked the teacher- my main tea	really	R	PREVB	tp
called him . So this is like a really long story . But- so I- so I ca	really	R	NPAM	tp
ns . They're , you know- i- it's really- it's really very- it's sad , y	really	R	PREJJ	tp
know . I- like there's- there's really very little that like holds me	really	R	POSTVB	tp
was exciting . I mean , that was really pretty- that was pretty cool .	really	R	PREJJ	tp
gie . The- they- we come from a really bougie fam- you know . We are .	really	R	NPAM	tp
imagination o- of children is really not sparked like it used to be	really	R	PREJJ	tp
for a while they were getting really good , um , pretty decent acts .	really	R	PREJJ	tp
t comes to town . Um , but yeah , really I mean there's- there- not a g	really	R	PREVB	tp
so , you know , there's nothing really , um , there's not a lot going o	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ecify , but d- honestly I don't really- I don't know . I- I've seen , u	really	R	PREVB	tp
s going on in the community is really lacking . Um , so , um , you know ,	really	R	PREJJ	tp
it , and like it- it was just a really beautiful thing . And that's th	really	R	NPAM	tp
how- Alright , so you got these really cool shops and stores and bake	really	R	NPAM	tp
a way where it's- cause- cause really I drive down that way , and- an	really	R	PREVB	tp
enjoyed going to th- and- and really w- what , you know- and then ev	really	R	PREVB	tp
olice a higher person ? No , not really they just have the law by thei	really	R	POSTVB	tp
help us out . Because we don't really have a experienced small forwa	really	R	PREVB	tp
rd that really could take us to the champions	really	R	PREVB	tp
h > It a- n- < laugh > I mean , it really is . Yeah , man . A- it's like , r	really	R	PREVB	tp
apsule , uh spaceship . A rocket really wa- it was a rocket . And they	really	R	PREVB	tp
' t remember that well . Cause I really didn't pay attention to none o	really	R	PREVB	tp
And band was extremely fun , I really loved that . Um , yeah , that bas	really	R	PREVB	tp
as- I'm being honest , I- I was really scared . Uh . I didn't have sex	really	R	PREJJ	tp
here , that was u- that w- that really all was set up not for the com	really	R	PREVB	tp
ly collar , no bellbottoms . You really ain't gonna see no dude in no	really	R	PREVB	tp
n there so she could thinks we really working . You see it ? I say , no	really	R	PREVB	tp
it's I had- in my first time , really . She used to come and see me w	really	R	POSTVB	tp
thinking about the space thing really . Okay . We get into science and	really	R	POSTVB	tp
e kings and queens but they're really pawns . And that's it that what	really	R	POSTVB	tp
g , like what's going on ? And I really didn't have words for it at th	really	R	PREVB	tp
t I mean , looking back , I just really don't think that the way that	really	R	PREVB	tp
at other people really like detached themselves like	really	R	PREVB	tp
like I could really relate to them , um , in ways th	really	R	PREVB	tp
, you know , like , um , that was really awesome . And I- and I- I felt	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ng too . But , um , that was like really eye-opening for me , uh , cause	really	R	PREJJ	tp
myself doing that . Um , and it really wasn't , you know- my job was ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
ment for a while , and that was really awesome , um , cause I wasn't pa	really	R	PREJJ	tp
um , to help their health . So I really liked doing that . Um , I ended	really	R	PREVB	tp
d you know , like- but that was really nice to be able to offer this	really	R	PREJJ	tp
um , < laugh > and I'm l- yeah , I really loved that job . Um , h- a- in i	really	R	PREVB	tp
ified , um , but th- they didn't really know how to decide , and they d	really	R	PREVB	tp
ork > . Um , and that was a job I really loved . And , um , a- i- so that	really	R	PREVB	tp
sically saying this body don't really wanna shit , so let me start ki	really	R	PREVB	tp
know , cause we only listen to really throwback music around now . Th	really	R	NPAM	tp
hat's k- little old now . Um , I really don't know the artist's names .	really	R	PREVB	tp
ican bear grease . Nah , I don't really listen to nothing too much . I	really	R	PREVB	tp
a black studies degree and not really knowing how to like sell mysel	really	R	PREVB	tp
t all of this out . I was like , really pissed off . Um , so I bounced a	really	R	PREJJ	tp
schools are operated really has ever been my thing . So I d	really	R	PREVB	tp
ework . So , um , < ts > just never really worked that w- well . I would j	really	R	PREVB	tp
put in . So she's like , I ain't really writing nothing in there . So s	really	R	PREVB	tp
f , I- I probably woulda been a really good student . Um , but I just n	really	R	NPAM	tp
, I- i- I don't think that was really great advice , you know . ( laugh	really	R	NPAM	tp
- luckily he was right , and he really- he helped me , um , you know , w	really	R	PREVB	tp
l , how many fatalities now ? E- really ? I know , I heard- read about t	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ool > . Um , but I mean , that was really like , what if I didn't ? You kn	really	R	POSTVB	tp
um , being in Rochester and not really looking critically at some of	really	R	PREVB	tp
e most history , um , and it was really beautiful , like living in the	really	R	PREJJ	tp
those two new dorms . So it was really actually very nice . Um , you kn	really	R	PREJJ	tp
that building . And so that was really awesome . And , um , so I lived ,	really	R	PREJJ	tp
, I want her . So , um , that was really awesome . This girl , uh , < name >	really	R	PREJJ	tp
looking at , um , our education really got worse with integration . W-	really	R	PREVB	tp
ow , that woulda really sucked . He only told me to ( la	really	R	PREVB	tp
me , so , I think , uh , it's just really , uh , < exhale > challenging . Um ,	really	R	PREJJ	tp
lexing to them . Uh , they don't really get it . Um , and so , um , I f- o	really	R	PREVB	tp
kids or not . Or n- no , it's ? really actually not a question of whe	really	R	POSTVB	tp
k ? Ha , yeah . I probably did . I really can't- you know we just kind o	really	R	PREVB	tp
a recreation center , that was really important to my development . S	really	R	PREJJ	tp
school and the SATs , I'm like really just gobbling up language . So ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
with students , wow . You sound really smart , you're using words I'm	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ain , get over the package . and really get to the heart of what's rea	really	R	PREVB	tp
t . Uh , one year of college . It really didn't work out too well . Hone	really	R	PREVB	tp
ple months in Florida , mm , not really nowhere major . I spent like tw	really	R	POSTVB	tp
growing up . So , like that was really , uh , tough trying to get like	really	R	POSTVB	tp
) the closest Wegmans ? Like , I really wanna go to Wegmans . Um , and y	really	R	PREVB	tp
dn't have a car . And like , you really need a car to live in Rocheste	really	R	PREVB	tp
ool , as soon as I could . Um , I really enjoyed going there . Um , you k	really	R	PREVB	tp
ryday , like I just- I just was really involved in that community cen	really	R	PREJJ	tp
what kind of environment I was really in . But it wasn't until I got	really	R	POSTVB	tp
> that I was like , dang , I was really poor . < laugh > Like it was just	really	R	PREJJ	tp
, like , oh okay , I- dang , I- I really did grow up , like , in a- a dis	really	R	PREVB	tp
for high school . And that was really- and it- So , those- the < schoo	really	R	POSTVB	tp
l > School was really close . I could just , walk up t	really	R	PREJJ	tp
< laugh > And boy he didn't- he really didn't like that you know ? But	really	R	PREVB	tp
ed all of it , you know , it was really something . It sure is . Well , y	really	R	POSTVB	tp
well all of ' em is very funny really because uh Binghamton , he's al	really	R	POSTJJ	tp
at's about the onliest games I really liked . Well um one person taki	really	R	PREVB	tp
ed basketball , baseball , I did really like . And , and Ice Pick , what	really	R	PREVB	tp
Well the last one that was- I really- I don't even know any of that	really	R	PREVB	tp
m , and so , yeah , it wa- it was really unfortunate . And political sci	really	R	PREJJ	tp
I feel like the only reason I really applied to < school > honestly i	really	R	PREVB	tp
I met at < school > so that was really good . And so , just having thos	really	R	PREJJ	tp
e resources . But I think I had really good teachers who , uh , really	really	R	NPAM	tp
> So I- and so then I met like really good teachers like that went t	really	R	NPAM	tp
you walk through , like it was really intense . Um , uh , but- and so l	really	R	PREJJ	tp
I didn't- I don't even think I really told many peo- d- many people	really	R	PREVB	tp
t he- it was , you know , it was really- it was really nice in the the	really	R	PREJJ	tp
s wife , but sh- of course , she really wasn't . And she went into the	really	R	PREVB	tp
hat he was dead . And what they really did , they put him on a ship , a	really	R	PREVB	tp
. And if- and they ain't gonna really keep it one thousand when nigg	really	R	PREVB	tp
let a nigga know what the fuck really going on , you feel me . Shit , e	really	R	PREVB	tp
I mean , you feel me . It's not really the- the- the real army type s	really	R	POSTVB	tp
t , bro , never again Dang , that really- ( laughing ) bro , yes , bro . You	really	R	PREVB	tp
but I'm twenty-seven , but I'm really twenty-four , so it- at the end	really	R	POSTVB	tp
you saying that , a- when you really look at shit , it's like- it's	really	R	PREVB	tp
le of niggas ' shit , and niggas really wasn't spitting shit . But that	really	R	PREVB	tp
up the front all the time . We really something . Nah , I didn't mind	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ave to do something because he really taking advantage of us . Take o	really	R	PREVB	tp
t coulda got in the club , that really- He say , nah . He had other thi	really	R	PREVB	tp
I come from , you know , it was really nice . I mean it was a rough an	really	R	PREJJ	tp
the clothes and things that I really wanted but never ab- could aff	really	R	PREVB	tp
buy them everything that they really want . And I'd bring my wife fr	really	R	PREVB	tp
ople from the outside . I don't really believe that like the crime in	really	R	PREVB	tp
ow , that's the onliest time we really have for family reunion . We uh	really	R	PREVB	tp
the blow but it wasn't nothing really . So uh , that evening I got off	really	R	POSTVB	tp
e were real small then , and we really , you know , we couldn't take ca	really	R	PREVB	tp
a crossing guard there , so it really wasn't- oh- we just would uh-	really	R	PREVB	tp
as in the fourth grade . When I really started messing with hair . Mm-	really	R	PREVB	tp
But , it was- it was rough . We really felt it then . And you cou- loo	really	R	PREVB	tp
r he was assassinated . When it really got better here . Well , it star	really	R	PREVB	tp
black all their lives , so they really didn't wanna mix . But um , yeah	really	R	PREVB	tp
ison him , but she wasn't gonna really do it . And she wanted to get c	really	R	PREVB	tp
fferent things , and they could really help their children . Yeah . Mm-	really	R	PREVB	tp
ike it . < laugh > Mm-mm . I don't really like this . I likeded Michigan	really	R	PREVB	tp
we usually have . Yeah . < ts > I really want to go to um , uh , Vegas . Y	really	R	PREVB	tp
r customers about dead . Mm-hm . Really is . Really . And I got one lady	really	R	POSTVB	tp
Over ni- over and over . And I really thought I was gonna die then .	really	R	PREVB	tp
it used to be , so I been just really going down , it look like ever	really	R	PREVB	tp
ut there . And I said , now they really know what that said . < laugh > S	really	R	PREVB	tp
ong pretty good now . Uh-huh . I really do . Mm-hm . < ts > Well , we didn '	really	R	PREVB	tp
ful space . That was really h- h- Yeah . you know people en	really	R	POSTVB	tp
t , but I didn't like it , but I really you know got interested in tha	really	R	PREVB	tp
ugh to you . And so you- so she really uh was outstanding teaching at	really	R	PREVB	tp
know , I feel like I- um , it's really cool just to see . And , um , it '	really	R	PREJJ	tp
rch and stuff like that . So , I really like living there . It's expens	really	R	PREVB	tp
ive , but I really like living there . ( laughing )	really	R	PREVB	tp
And I really , uh , like the work that I'm do	really	R	PREVB	tp
t like , but I think overall , I really like living there . Yeah , < laug	really	R	PREVB	tp
l pretty sad . And I often feel really guilty I guess . Um , especially	really	R	PREJJ	tp
with my family , uh , cause they really struggle financially . And I su	really	R	PREVB	tp
them financially , but I don't really do it , as much , um , so , that's	really	R	PREVB	tp
really difficult I think . Um , and it '	really	R	PREJJ	tp
gs . And so I think it's always really challenging coming home . And ,	really	R	PREJJ	tp
y , I'm ready to go . And I feel really bad about that , but I- I- I us	really	R	PREJJ	tp
go . Uh , just because , uh , it's really difficult for me to see my fam	really	R	PREJJ	tp
nd he just take and if you got really mean in class , he'll take and	really	R	PREJJ	tp
, and uh I think that's when I really lost , really lost disinterest	really	R	PREVB	tp
far as teachers go . Uh no . Not really , but uh , like uh writing somet	really	R	POSTVB	tp
, um , baseball player . Yeah . I really would . No , um Well I- I- I- I	really	R	PREVB	tp
as uh uh , you gotta- you gotta really know somebody , you know . And t	really	R	PREVB	tp
hen they ask me questions it's really about kids , they'll ask que- a	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ied . And when I say that , that really , s- strikes a chord with them	really	R	PREVB	tp
hat and I'm just like , uh , not really . Um , and- and things like that	really	R	POSTVB	tp
not like Future , and I didn't really like listening , like , sitting	really	R	PREVB	tp
nd some of them actually don't really know what that means in terms	really	R	PREVB	tp
ven when I come home , it's not really home , because I have to stay w	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ry good , I'm very happy , and I really am . Like , I'm not putting on b	really	R	PREVB	tp
e I said , because of it's just really- mentally , uh , it's , really di	really	R	POSTVB	tp
st so different , um , yeah . Uh , really just like meeting up with peop	really	R	PREVB	tp
e and stuff like that . I'm not really into that , that's what they're	really	R	POSTVB	tp
so I- it- it's- it's actually really challenging to come home . And	really	R	PREJJ	tp
you can plan , but it- it never really works out really . Never go alo	really	R	PREVB	tp
t it- it was a couple guys got really hurt , and I- I got wounded mys	really	R	PREJJ	tp
t , you know . And uh I enjoy it really , because I get around and see	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ave to pick something . Um , but really just kind of- of meeting up wi	really	R	PREVB	tp
uh it's a lot of bad kids now , really , you know . And uh they don't-	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ob security yet , uh , you can't really do that . Um , so , I just decide	really	R	PREVB	tp
ealing with those students was really a profound moment . You know , h	really	R	POSTVB	tp
huh . Oh yeah . Yeah . Uh-huh . It really was . Oh yeah , I had , there was	really	R	PREVB	tp
ut outside of academics , I was really involved in the Black Student '	really	R	PREJJ	tp
, um , groups . And I think that really helped me to , um , understand ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
uff on campus and I think that really , uh , made me f- uh , enjoy my e	really	R	PREVB	tp
e . Um , um , so I think that was really comforting to see . Ooh sorry .	really	R	PREJJ	tp
actually in DC . And so it was really cool to reconnect with those p	really	R	PREJJ	tp
nk it might be worth it . I was really shocked to- to see like three	really	R	PREJJ	tp
le who work on the staff , like really , uh , made the difference , uh ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
n to go to grad school . But it really , was my advisor , < name > I don '	really	R	PREVB	tp
e , j- just taking it , I didn't really know that I w- I would be that	really	R	PREVB	tp
le experience in math . I lo- I really enjoyed math , but I just didn '	really	R	PREVB	tp
tnered with her , and , um , that really made the difference , to kind o	really	R	PREVB	tp
nk through that experience , it really was transformative . Um , and so	really	R	PREVB	tp
e to seven years . Like I don't really , you know , I don't know about	really	R	PREVB	tp
professor . Um , who I felt was really looking out for me the whole t	really	R	PREVB	tp
Um , and so , I think that that really made the difference . Um , and a	really	R	PREVB	tp
ing in , getting like- I didn't really like- you know , people would p	really	R	PREVB	tp
passed away where it was just really difficult to , try to , you know	really	R	PREJJ	tp
works for me is to- to get up really early and to go . And somehow p	really	R	POSTVB	tp
stay late . I feel like people really value that in my program . And	really	R	PREVB	tp
long term gro- goals . And that really helped me , but I felt like , um	really	R	PREVB	tp
ur hours I can get some , like , really good stuff done . And so , I jus	really	R	NPAM	tp
projects . And so , I think that really helped my transition and like ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
ia . Like , you know , just like , really ? You know , ( laughing ) so , just	really	R	POSTVB	tp
posal . And I think it was just really , uh , hard , because , you know ,	really	R	PREJJ	tp
all the time . Um , p- it's just really challenging , and so for me , I	really	R	PREJJ	tp
t's just- um , yeah it was just really- it's a really rough transitio	really	R	NPAM	tp
issertation phase , like , it is really really difficult , because you	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ool . And so , uh , that was just really challenging . Um , in terms of l	really	R	PREJJ	tp
h an isolated experience . It's really about you and your own work an	really	R	POSTVB	tp
meone else that shows that you really- really know your- your stuff .	really	R	PREVB	tp
think it was just really hard . Um , c- so , my program we	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ucc . I'm Gucc . Where everybody really started off at , you feel me , l	really	R	PREVB	tp
g the building . But y- I- the- really , that was a- that was a beauti	really	R	PREVB	tp
hit him at a time when he was really vulnerable , like cash flow was	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ato , seven potato , or . I don't really know what it is but- Yeah . Oh ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
had broken this treaty , but it really wasn't the people . It- of the	really	R	PREVB	tp
hat he'd already answered . Not really . In a way it was my fault . He '	really	R	POSTVB	tp
r and in her books and nothing really happened . No . Not that I can t	really	R	PREVB	tp
something like that . Well , not really , you know . I- I watch it and y	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ou know , I don't really remember about what happened t	really	R	PREVB	tp
nd all that , you know . I don't really know if I'm qualified or not ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
ng and things . And that's what really blew my mind , you know . I didn	really	R	PREVB	tp
white people down there , they really didn't like him . And uh , you k	really	R	PREVB	tp
you know , who- who the killer really was . And uh , him and the uh- t	really	R	PREVB	tp
things get together , and they really you know , start liking each ot	really	R	PREVB	tp
t i- you know it's the year- I really don't have any favorite subjec	really	R	PREVB	tp
f my friends that I would call really loyal , they're in New York . Uh	really	R	PREJJ	tp
l as some spices . So it tasted really good . It filled me up . No , I'm	really	R	PREJJ	tp
lot of uh , movement and t- r- really taxing sports . In the neighbor	really	R	NPAM	tp
arian , not vegan . Vegans don't really eat like , um , they don't drink	really	R	PREVB	tp
w one from Lee Daniels , that's really good . Uh , I watch Power . Um , <	really	R	PREJJ	tp
on . And , what's another show I really really really- I like movies a	really	R	PREVB	tp
way true or whatever . I don't really know , but I like watching it .	really	R	PREVB	tp
at's my channel I go to when I really wanna learn somebody's backgro	really	R	PREVB	tp
family members there , but not really . Like , I still know I was the	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ostly our traditions . We don't really do nothing major l- oh , and li	really	R	POSTVB	tp
l I get to travel , but I don't really do the whole birthdays thing ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
< address > projects . And it was really bad around that time , so even	really	R	PREVB	tp
my mom and her sisters didn't really grow with their mom , so make-	really	R	PREVB	tp
years , probably longer , can't really remember . But um , it's differe	really	R	PREVB	tp
is about their home . They not really more so about fashion . Up ther	really	R	POSTVB	tp
and stuff out here , so you not really gonna bump into that many peop	really	R	PREVB	tp
whole experience in school- I really loved , um , kindergarten cause	really	R	PREVB	tp
ng me candy all the time , so I really love kindergarten , and rest in	really	R	PREVB	tp
to do it . And then I was never really was like a meat lover anyways .	really	R	POSTVB	tp
, and uh , other kinds of games really . Um , sports that uh , um , requi	really	R	POSTVB	tp
aid , um , to help her , cause it really wasn't , I mean conducive somet	really	R	PREVB	tp
that was a process they had to really watch . Mm-hm . Mm-hm . Mm . Yeah ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
o do to get there . Uh , I don't really consider a lot of people frien	really	R	PREVB	tp
h . I'd like to go to Africa . I really want a giraffe . We should get	really	R	PREVB	tp
week , and then had kids ? That really is . I think I'm'a go for presi	really	R	PREVB	tp
e > Physical fight ? Hm . I don't really- Mine definitely wasn't in gra	really	R	PREVB	tp
ver and still have fun and not really part- feel a particular way ab	really	R	PREVB	tp
ed to this colored man . It was really funny . That part was funny , an	really	R	PREJJ	tp
all the rest of it , but it was really funny . Mm-hm . Mm-hm . This remi	really	R	PREJJ	tp
uh is a wonderful actor , and I really enjoy that . I see it almost ev	really	R	PREVB	tp
in my music I think was really obstacles in my life . Um , one	really	R	POSTVB	tp
going on these days . Um , what really kept me from being mainstream	really	R	PREVB	tp
feelings about him . Um , Don't really think about him . I don't like	really	R	PREVB	tp
school was pretty good . I did really good in school . I was all A's	really	R	POSTVB	tp
of the time . Um- no , we don't really have that many requirements . W	really	R	PREVB	tp
Mr. Smith . I don't know who's really the big man of the school , but	really	R	POSTVB	tp
know what the requirements are really , but I know I got in , and my l	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ry beginning again . And nobody really liked her . She was fired at th	really	R	PREVB	tp
ed . The parents were , cause we really weren't learning anything . I m	really	R	PREVB	tp
um for playing cards- I wasn't really playing cards . This boy was sh	really	R	PREVB	tp
til you really understand they culture , or tr	really	R	PREVB	tp
cultures . You know , you don't really know another person culture un	really	R	PREVB	tp
first grade for a year . When I really should have been in the second	really	R	PREVB	tp
rade , she was very nice . And I really worked in her and my mom was r	really	R	PREVB	tp
when you die , it's your- it's really your time to go . Cause the oth	really	R	POSTVB	tp
< name > . And then , let's see , I really loved , um , I think that was fi	really	R	PREVB	tp
and then one day , he would um , really teach us English , and then the	really	R	PREVB	tp
now . Usually things that I wa- really want , I get them before Christ	really	R	PREVB	tp
kle football . I mean it wasn't really tackle football , and the girls	really	R	POSTVB	tp
art of the day . Well we didn't really play games . We played on the g	really	R	PREVB	tp
rls in our class , but we don't really- When we talking about them to	really	R	PREVB	tp
m . Um- Well , I don't know they really j- just have to be outgoing an	really	R	PREVB	tp
ks perfect English , so I don't really know if he's- really talks the	really	R	PREVB	tp
to < school > . I r- And which I really I don't wanna go to < school > .	really	R	PREVB	tp
cher . His name was Mr. < name > . Really on the hefty side , rest in pea	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ce Mr. < name > . But he really , um , motivated us to be good p	really	R	PREVB	tp
person , so he motivated me . I really liked that class . That was a m	really	R	PREVB	tp
ything . So I don't think I was really like , noticed until , oh , of co	really	R	PREVB	tp
perience . So , Um . I can't even really say that I've changed , cause I	really	R	PREVB	tp
pid fashion shows . That wasn't really a fashion show . But like , for	really	R	POSTVB	tp
re . And- and it- I started off really small . And I'm still doing it ,	really	R	PREJJ	tp
I can't do it forever , I don't really wanna do it for much longer . I	really	R	PREVB	tp

ally , I found out , that that's really what- that's about the hardest	really	R	POSTVB	tp
But it just wasn't for me . It really wasn't for me . But , I- I- I gr	really	R	PREVB	tp
ying down , it was when she was really messed up . inaudible inaudible	really	R	PREJJ	tp
in love this man . And she was really confused , and she- she was jus	really	R	PREJJ	tp
something like dope because it really sent her crazy , you know . And	really	R	PREVB	tp
movie star , and um , she r- she really , you know she- It's some- I sa	really	R	PREVB	tp
college eight years . Um , mm , I really- Um , it's between teacher and	really	R	PREVB	tp

o that ? Yeah . That's great . Oh really ? Oh wow . I know they have a ba	really	R	POSTVB	tp
love with him , but she wasn't really in love with him . And Patty Du	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ame from um , New York , and she really was mixed up , you know . She di	really	R	PREVB	tp
football team though . It's not really basketball and- I mean , somewh	really	R	POSTVB	tp

like this < work > . If it looked really run down , people would never b	really	R	PREVB	tp
ected the music because that's really what this area is . But I think	really	R	POSTVB	tp
n Earth , Wind and Fire . People really felt those words , so that's th	really	R	PREVB	tp
DJ , my goal is not to make you really listen to the song so much . I	really	R	PREVB	tp
eel what I'm saying . You can't really- nobody's really singing about	really	R	PREVB	tp
reet . There's no difference in really the hiring process or the , you	really	R	POSTVB	tp
is that their children adopt a really negative attitude toward their	really	R	NPAM	tp

m a- OutKa- well , people don't really go to the OutKast lane too muc	really	R	PREVB	tp
s I understand it , and I don't really know all the you know specific	really	R	PREVB	tp
and and , and his cohorts they really don't care about us . And then	really	R	PREVB	tp
u have to forgive me , I have a really bad sinus condition . It- Um . T	really	R	NPAM	tp
So , s- th- th- thi- whi- that really caused me to or res- and it al	really	R	PREVB	tp
s a paid consultant , but I was really learning the whole thing . Um .	really	R	PREVB	tp
cal conduit and show us how to really get into this whole idea of um	really	R	PREVB	tp
u know I said you know , that's really a good idea . He said , well , I '	really	R	POSTVB	tp
now , if he had to buy it , he'd really be in trouble . So , Uh . He said	really	R	PREVB	tp
I and then somehow , th- I felt really wasn't what I wanted to do , yo	really	R	PREVB	tp
n two countries , um I- I had a really spectacular career doing that .	really	R	NPAM	tp
a marketing researcher . I did really very good work here in New Yor	really	R	NPAM	tp

to- into , um , a feeling that I really couldn't help those people . Be	really	R	PREVB	tp
ind of space , they can't . They really can't . And so , tha- tha- those	really	R	PREVB	tp
ly Atlanta . People can kind of really tell especially how- when , uh ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
ool > Middle school , so I never really had to take the cheese , but , y	really	R	PREVB	tp
hey need me , if they know they really need me , they can get in touch	really	R	PREVB	tp

was there . And uh , it's- it's really changed < laugh > from when I li	really	R	PREVB	tp
t- we just broke up and it was really something . Cause all of us loo	really	R	POSTVB	tp

alized at that moment that no , really , it's okay . He's- Nobody's per	really	R	PREVB	tp
ah I knew , but that experience really put me on guard . Going to the	really	R	PREVB	tp
rning environment actually . It really was . Um , so for the academic e	really	R	PREVB	tp
campus in a while . And I don't really know exactly how things feel t	really	R	PREVB	tp

ngel , cause he did a lot of d- really weird dumb things . A lot of we	really	R	NPAM	tp
r one cigarette . Said you must really have to have a cigarette bad .	really	R	PREVB	tp
moline . It's like- it's like a really , really heavy wax . And you nee	really	R	NPAM	tp
being a hu- you were hustling , really . Know . Came very very natural .	really	R	POSTVB	tp
I just remember it just being really really quiet , there were not a	really	R	PREJJ	tp
rhood was notor- it was- had a really bad reputation . So um , they j-	really	R	NPAM	tp
ghty one . So um , < ts > I wasn't really part of the in-crowd . I was a	really	R	POSTVB	tp
as complexion wise starts off really light skin and then as they gr	really	R	NPAM	tp
it , cause kids ca- kids can be really nasty you know . So it was noth	really	R	PREJJ	tp
se and my complexion and I had really long hair . And again my f- my	really	R	NPAM	tp
It's- I- y- you know , I don't really- I can't really say . But I mea	really	R	PREVB	tp
us and- and there was nothing really special about us it was just f	really	R	PREJJ	tp
wanted to be a cheerleader . I really have no idea why that became s	really	R	PREVB	tp
as- For me I felt at first , it really felt like a good transition . I	really	R	PREVB	tp
on't there's actually no- I- I really don't want people in my profes	really	R	PREVB	tp
HIV AIDS organization . And it really humbled me . Cause I had gotten	really	R	PREVB	tp
ou learned those things , and I really have to say , coming to < work >	really	R	PREVB	tp
ham- humbled me . It really did because when I'm- w- was a	really	R	PREVB	tp
mething- This regentrification really- has really angered me because	really	R	PREVB	tp
und some white folks . That ch- really did . It changed everything bec	really	R	PREVB	tp
in school . But yeah , I started really paying attention cause when I	really	R	PREVB	tp
t care about people . So < work > really helped restore my caring about	really	R	PREVB	tp
Adidas tennis shoes . No , they really didn't do the hat- well < name >	really	R	PREVB	tp

the town for one thing . It- it really clear- it really cleaned the t	really	R	PREVB	tp

A movie ? Yeah , that's- that's really- that's really my main goal , b	really	R	POSTVB	tp

uld- see , I haven't- I haven't really- what's the purpose of the boo	really	R	POSTVB	tp
t of terminology , too . I can't really speak on to the females , but y	really	R	PREVB	tp
lse , what else ? Shit I have to really be talking to , you know what I	really	R	PREVB	tp

ies , you know , I- shit I can't really tell you about the eighties , I	really	R	PREVB	tp
only certain spots that- that really got some good mumbo sauce , tho	really	R	PREVB	tp
on DC . We the only people that really have it , you might could have	really	R	PREVB	tp
the majority part , we all can really get together , have a good time	really	R	PREVB	tp

higan Park , Northeast , where I really wanted to live over by Catholi	really	R	PREVB	tp
our bond I think . And it just really kind of developed from that . A	really	R	POSTVB	tp
any understanding of what snow really was , and to- to help him exper	really	R	PREVB	tp
don't f- I feel like we don't really have a tradition tradition , bu	really	R	PREVB	tp
ge ain't even that . Yeah . It's really diff- Because I remember when	really	R	PREJJ	tp
blown because as me I was like really shy . I didn't wanna go up ther	really	R	PREJJ	tp
stuff . I think that's when you really become the person that you lat	really	R	PREVB	tp
o . Right . Whichever college- I really wanna go to a school that has	really	R	PREVB	tp
a t- externally and internally really make you happy . It's not . Mm-m	really	R	PREVB	tp
and everything . They're doing really good , I- I like Black Alley . Y	really	R	POSTVB	tp
oing a lot- they've been doing really great . Like , they've got to pl	really	R	POSTVB	tp
hey did the uh , Hello remix . I really like that . But yeah , I go to l	really	R	PREVB	tp
beat for the congos , it's like really get your adrenaline flowing , i	really	R	PREVB	tp
ou would dan- it- it's v- it's really good exercise . I mean , that's	really	R	NPAM	tp
go sound , and then the singers really make it come to life . So , each	really	R	PREVB	tp
a family . But my main focus is really on children because it's so ma	really	R	POSTVB	tp
all the seats where everything really happens and then in the- um , i	really	R	PREVB	tp
and stuff like that . So , it's really been hard , < ts > so . Usually ev	really	R	PREVB	tp
w old is this kid ? I was like , really ? He said , their conversations	really	R	POSTVB	tp
d , she was like , cause this is really good . She said , I wanna publis	really	R	PREJJ	tp
eir arch enemies . < laugh > It's really cute , and he wrote it actually	really	R	PREJJ	tp
igh school experience was- was really awesome . < ts > It was awesome .	really	R	PREJJ	tp
king at the teachers like , you really let them talk to y'all like th	really	R	PREVB	tp
uh , the essence of it was for really the children to rebuild , resto	really	R	POSTVB	tp
it because I don't think they really want to revisit the ugly past .	really	R	PREVB	tp
erries . But um , what I- what I really remember most of all was going	really	R	PREVB	tp
black families here , cause you really don't see that many . Unless yo	really	R	PREVB	tp
per-middle class families that really don't need to live on the Lowe	really	R	PREVB	tp
Jewish families , my mother was really close friends with a lot of Je	really	R	NPAM	tp
nd not serve alcohol . So it is really ridiculous . You know , like , my	really	R	PREJJ	tp
you see now . The bars were not really in our community . Like , now on	really	R	POSTVB	tp
e , you right . He said , I never really did notice that , he said , but ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
mes are good so I don't really think I have a best memory . We	really	R	PREVB	tp
ls was always fun . But I don't really think- I mean , like all the ti	really	R	PREVB	tp
best friend . So , after that , I really apologized when- once < name > a	really	R	PREVB	tp
ree girls . Definitely . Um . Not really cause they was like Older than	really	R	POSTVB	tp
' m moving right now so I don't really claim a neighborhood . But if I	really	R	PREVB	tp
, I didn't start going outside really until I was like , third grade	really	R	POSTVB	tp
And I knew it but like nothing really- It wasn't even more where I l	really	R	POSTVB	tp
< ts > Um , mm , I don't- I don't really know , I don't . I don't think s	really	R	PREVB	tp
an that it's still the same , I really never thought about it that wa	really	R	PREVB	tp
e scary movies though . Yeah , I really don't , but . But it would be- i	really	R	PREVB	tp
as so nice . I don't know . I- I really liked pre-K . and I- it's proba	really	R	PREVB	tp
he probably be dressing up and really bringing this thing to life wi	really	R	PREVB	tp
up . And- they're- and they're really doing it . My dad has been- um ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
can't- < ts > < name > I mean , not really but kind of . I could- I could	really	R	POSTVB	tp
And it wasn't- I knew that he really wasn't trying to say nothing t	really	R	PREVB	tp
an do . But other than that not really . I mean , no . I like to act . An	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ctress . Entrepreneur . I'm just really good of it- really good at it .	really	R	PREJJ	tp
dy always telling me like , I'm really good at crying on scene when y	really	R	PREJJ	tp
don't ? know why . But like I'm really good on crying on scene and st	really	R	PREJJ	tp
uff . I'm really good at acting and I've al- An	really	R	PREJJ	tp
t's what everybody said like I really wanted to be different . And th	really	R	PREVB	tp
I've been thinking about it . I really- acting is really something I	really	R	PREVB	tp
e going to . So I- I d- I don't really try to think about it too much	really	R	PREVB	tp
overwhelms me . But I don't- I really don't know which college . Mm .	really	R	PREVB	tp
if you're showing me that I'm really being- that you really don't t	really	R	PREVB	tp
rust me with something I'm really gonna fix it , cause you suppos	really	R	PREVB	tp
nd my friend had felt like she really couldn't trust me with somethi	really	R	PREVB	tp
tead of me telling them . And I really wanna work on that . Cause I'm-	really	R	PREVB	tp
I've- I'm really a great friend . I- I know I co	really	R	POSTVB	tp
nds cause you never know who's really your friend . And that has happ	really	R	POSTVB	tp
t her with everything , I could really pour into her . But the other f	really	R	PREVB	tp
e > and < name > and < name > ain't really wanna be my friends cause they	really	R	PREVB	tp
uch so . Yep . I think it hasn't really decreased . I think it's become	really	R	PREJJ	tp
en I got here , I was just like really impressed with the the differe	really	R	PREJJ	tp
cough > I'm sorry , my mouth got really dry . Get some water . Would you	really	R	PREJJ	tp
re on < address > , it was rough . Really , really rough . All of Forsyth	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ays over there . And , um , I was really close with them . All their nam	really	R	PREJJ	tp
his real name . But , uh , I was really close with them . < ts > And then	really	R	PREJJ	tp
sense . Um , her and my mom are really good friends and actually when	really	R	NPAM	tp
n on with your family ? No , not really , kind of sort of , we just go o	really	R	POSTVB	tp
y don't like you , you could be really singing . I said they will have	really	R	PREVB	tp
ere very close . Um , but yeah I really liked . the neighborhood Um , < t	really	R	PREVB	tp
a lot . And , uh , we l- we were really close to a playground , a tenni	really	R	PREJJ	tp
a lot . Um , and then one of my really good- like my best friend from	really	R	NPAM	tp
e stairs , and my sister's just really funny . Like she doesn't really	really	R	PREJJ	tp
rst showed us the house , I was really impressed just because I never	really	R	PREJJ	tp
hborhood . < ts > It's just like , really nice . And the houses were so b	really	R	PREJJ	tp
hat was cool . < ts > But I don't really like change so I still didn't	really	R	PREVB	tp
first grade . Um , < ts > I don't really know how we became friends . I	really	R	PREVB	tp
Um , < ts > Yeah so growing up I really liked , um , the first house we	really	R	PREVB	tp
And I always thought that was really cool . Um , so I guess I just st	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ess like , uh , English . I'm not really good at math . math I hate math	really	R	PREJJ	tp
d science was just okay . And I really liked reading . So yeah I guess	really	R	PREVB	tp
)- I just thought it was like , really interesting and like , the way	really	R	PREJJ	tp
solely on them , and they don't really look at like , just the fact th	really	R	PREVB	tp
like , mental illness was also really interesting to me . That's why	really	R	PREJJ	tp
just think that would also be really interesting to do . Just becaus	really	R	PREJJ	tp
aphasia . Um , < ts > and I'm also really interested in Linguistics so l	really	R	PREJJ	tp
use like working in the lab is really boring . Cause all I do is tran	really	R	PREJJ	tp
scribe things . And I'm like really good with people so I feel lik	really	R	PREJJ	tp
l the rules and stuff . I don't really know how to explain it . But th	really	R	PREVB	tp
do . No . No . I just- I just- I really was unprepared when I got to t	really	R	PREVB	tp
ed for that change . Like I was really behind in my math class becaus	really	R	POSTVB	tp
had got engaged so she wasn't really interested in like teaching . <	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ecame friends that way . Yeah I really can't remember how we became f	really	R	PREVB	tp
on . And then now , um , I don't really know cause the job is really n	really	R	PREVB	tp
dad's < name > ? Okay . < ts > It's really crazy . < laugh > Yeah . < ts > My m	really	R	PREJJ	tp
Um , it's fun . Like , it's really festive . Um , I usually dress u	really	R	PREJJ	tp
on Thirteenth Street we didn't really have a lot of- of drugs at tha	really	R	PREVB	tp
t of their lives . People don't really see themselves as leaving here	really	R	PREVB	tp
cause they d- they- they- they really don't know . You know , they're-	really	R	PREVB	tp
leave . Whereas the people that really live here they can't afford to	really	R	PREVB	tp
ur neighbors are , they- you're really connected to you neighbors . Li	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ngest son in ninety-six , I got really , really sick . So , I got really	really	R	PREJJ	tp
d I discussed that . And it was really a lot for him making the- the	really	R	POSTVB	tp
aziness and landlord . I didn't really wanna come back , but I think I	really	R	PREVB	tp
ot that she pushed me out . She really didn't , but it was just- we ju	really	R	PREVB	tp
my health and everything . She really didn't want me going too far a	really	R	PREVB	tp
des the train . So . < ts > It was really cool . After high school I went	really	R	PREJJ	tp
en it was put up . Really , really nice . And everybody was like ,	really	R	PREJJ	tp
his really fancy place . It was so nice wh	really	R	NPAM	tp
we all thought they were like , really rich kids . Cause Compost was t	really	R	NPAM	tp
, she was- nope . My mother was really like , very strict . Yeah . And s	really	R	PREJJ	tp
t all that stuff until like , I really started like , getting known wi	really	R	PREVB	tp
now . So it was- it was- it was really interesting . I remember all my	really	R	PREJJ	tp
er or someone from Queens , but really knowing that , you know , I was	really	R	PREVB	tp
e accent of the community . And really , you know , not really identify	really	R	PREVB	tp
then on it- it just got really- it got really bad . And so um ,	really	R	PREJJ	tp
to get hurt . She hurt her back really bad , and , um , I remember from	really	R	PREJJ	tp
rself , single mom , three kids . Really , really hard at the time for h	really	R	PREJJ	tp
w . Yeah . It's gated in , it was really , really nice . And I believe it	really	R	PREJJ	tp
m . So , um . < ts > They met , I- I really can't remember exactly the who	really	R	PREVB	tp
them slang words behind , so I really don't even know anymore . To be	really	R	PREVB	tp
t like we was his kids , so . He really had a impact on me . So . That's	really	R	PREVB	tp
ll in all I think they need to really focus on the inner city people	really	R	PREVB	tp
eet . Yeah , eighty-five . It was really bad . It was a lot of prostitut	really	R	PREJJ	tp
now what I'm saying , you gotta really really be like open minded to	really	R	PREVB	tp
English at that time . So , they really didn't know it's okay to have	really	R	PREVB	tp
ever forget who- who cared . R- really were . Really . Um . I was more f	really	R	PREVB	tp
can't tell you why , so I don't really know . Now as I've gotten older	really	R	PREVB	tp
ause that's when she and I got really really close . I mean we were t	really	R	PREJJ	tp
and I didn't take the time to really learn it . Ha- < ts > Hand dancin	really	R	PREVB	tp
me that before , um , so I never really had a perspective on that . I j	really	R	PREVB	tp
about it , my generation didn't really do it a lot . I learned it from	really	R	PREVB	tp
, if I go anywhere- It doesn't really matter where I go . Most people	really	R	PREVB	tp
t it was just- Because if you- Really , they- The people that lived i	really	R	PREVB	tp
m , dating for me was- I didn't really date . Dating for me I sat on t	really	R	PREVB	tp
o go to dinner . Um , that was a really big in our family then , growin	really	R	PREJJ	tp
g up . That was really important to him . Um , so now-	really	R	PREJJ	tp
happy . At the harbor , I don't really have any favorites . I l- There	really	R	PREVB	tp
Five , I love that place . It's really nice . Because it- there are ti	really	R	PREJJ	tp
e history behind it . So I'd- I really enjoy that . I really enjoy tha	really	R	PREVB	tp
se I look at that's how people really should be . Why- why- why would	really	R	PREVB	tp
p breath of- < sigh > It's like , really ? Because it's like he- he was	really	R	POSTVB	tp
f- for young people , or anyone really , no one control you unless you	really	R	POSTVB	tp
before , because like I didn't really wanna live here . And also , I w	really	R	PREVB	tp
we forget about him ? No , never really . No . I mean . I n- doesn't matt	really	R	POSTVB	tp
hree thousand dollars . Did you really mean that ? And we went into th	really	R	PREVB	tp
I couldn't play , but . I sucked really . < laugh > But , I think I got on	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ple coming in . So now , there's really nobody to talk to , you know , t	really	R	POSTVB	tp
lve myself in it , so it didn't really You know . But you did see it ,	really	R	POSTVB	tp
of it . You know . And it didn't really . Yeah . It didn't really you kn	really	R	POSTVB	tp
at . I mean , I didn't see that , really . I mean it was there but , you	really	R	POSTVB	tp
were still there . So , I didn't really , you know , you know , you kind	really	R	POSTVB	tp
. I mean , not with me . I never really got into that , but . I know- I	really	R	PREVB	tp
he rest of the guys . It wasn't really all that , but . It was somethin	really	R	POSTVB	tp
have to go out . You'd have to really go- I wanna think- it was like	really	R	PREVB	tp
t someone has done to you , you really never know what a person has g	really	R	PREVB	tp
tive stuff , in < address > and I really would like to work with the te	really	R	PREVB	tp
ent out and we saw how much we really needed one another , we were al	really	R	PREVB	tp
ve millions of dollars , I mean really rich people . They had literall	really	R	NPAM	tp
ny time . You know , truancy was really really big then so they kind o	really	R	PREJJ	tp
at . Um , junior high school was really good . It was the first time I	really	R	PREJJ	tp
think I was a senior before I really realized where the gym was . < l	really	R	PREVB	tp
nancially . Mkay . Um , I had um , really good- very good foundation , ve	really	R	NPAM	tp
ance to experience- She didn't really know a whole lot about people	really	R	PREVB	tp
grounds , she realized that she really didn't know much of anything .	really	R	PREVB	tp
And she wasn't really fully prepared um , academicall	really	R	PREJJ	tp
e challenging , cause now she's really fighting for survival . But I w	really	R	PREVB	tp
I mean she's- she's- I've been really blessed . She's never given me	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ially since the weather's been really really nice . But I really don '	really	R	PREJJ	tp
, I stayed- I lived at home , I really didn't venture . I wasn't a par	really	R	PREVB	tp
yed ball for < work > . So that's really where I got my foundation as f	really	R	POSTVB	tp
s all my experiences as far as really DC goes um , because we got a c	really	R	PREVB	tp
omeless people back then . I- I really just don't . I don't . Because I	really	R	PREVB	tp
t me wrong . You know , I- But I really didn't do- I lived a very shel	really	R	PREVB	tp
hole c- all of DC , areas I had really never been in before . Going to	really	R	PREVB	tp
in < work > . Mm-hm . Yeah . No . I really don't have any . Mm-mm . Because	really	R	PREVB	tp
The whole U Street thing , I- I really- Except for driving through . Y	really	R	PREVB	tp
y from stuff like that . That's really the only way I can think of it	really	R	POSTVB	tp
nly occasionally were I- was I really allowed to ride the bus places	really	R	PREVB	tp
down to her level because she really had education and she had know	really	R	PREVB	tp
r than . Because now you're not really taking time to just walk baref	really	R	PREVB	tp
lly comes together and really gets ugly and say look . Uh . Fi	really	R	PREVB	tp
see ' em . Unless the community really comes together , and I mean rea	really	R	PREVB	tp
ts > And I don't see that . They really don't want us around . Trust me	really	R	PREVB	tp
g it . Now , the Lower East Side really is It's hard to say because it	really	R	PREVB	tp
was the East Village , but it's really not . It's still part of the Lo	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ybody . If If the landlord gets really nasty and decides he wants to	really	R	PREJJ	tp
n it . You know . Or if you were really good , and your father used the	really	R	PREJJ	tp
th so it goes across the floor really quick . And it's accurate , and	really	R	POSTVB	tp
r top floats across the ground really good . Yeah . Exactly . Exactly .	really	R	POSTVB	tp
u know ? There's no point to it really . Checkers . Slu- uh . We played	really	R	POSTVB	tp
up there , it ain't got no room really cause we was being placed with	really	R	POSTVB	tp
s . You d- you- Very seldom you really hear somebody , you know , fight	really	R	PREVB	tp
n there selling drugs ? Is that really important ? How is that gonna m	really	R	PREJJ	tp
w- it's money . Sorry . But it's really not . How far twenty thousand g	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ork again next week , like , I'm really , really broke . So , I think the	really	R	PREJJ	tp
I've seen on YouTube man . They really making moves . You know what I '	really	R	PREVB	tp
e often than not , people don't really get a shot . You know . But that	really	R	PREVB	tp
, if you're willing and you're really trying , you know what I'm sayi	really	R	PREVB	tp
ng to better myself , it is not really- it's just for me . It's not fo	really	R	POSTVB	tp
s that's going on that you can really tell . You know what I'm saying	really	R	PREVB	tp
do know , how much that , uh , I really look up to her . You know what	really	R	PREVB	tp
to breathe now . You know . And really you know the thing was , man . W	really	R	PREVB	tp
ur mama to breathe because she really didn't , you know , she gripped	really	R	PREVB	tp
ve a stroke like that , It just really throwed us off . and it really	really	R	PREVB	tp
s man . That- that wa- that was really close . That was real close . Yu	really	R	PREJJ	tp
So by this time , the cat that really didn't like me , he coming out	really	R	PREVB	tp
you . I was like , man , I ain't really tripping about all that , man .	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ow what I'm saying . Nothing really , you know , going on with this	really	R	POSTVB	tp
saying , there nothing that . We really both ain't got nothing , you kn	really	R	PREVB	tp
what I'm saying . Which I ain't really we weren't really tripping , I	really	R	PREJJ	tp
elieve it . And- and then I was really shocked because you had wrote	really	R	PREJJ	tp
mode when I came back here . I really didn't wanna be here . So I jus	really	R	PREVB	tp
wrong crowd . Well , I can't say really hanging with the wrong crowd ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
n . Lo-ho is really for me , it's no-ho . Cause we a	really	R	POSTVB	tp
south of Houston Street , it's really different from North of Housto	really	R	PREJJ	tp
like everything . Like , nothing really bothers me . Like everything ha	really	R	PREVB	tp
like that . But , that's how it really works and things like that . Um	really	R	PREVB	tp
an anything . Um . Me and school really didn't cut it . Um . As we keep	really	R	PREVB	tp
nd the other . And the ones who really getting over it is the one- ju	really	R	PREVB	tp
Um , and one of the r- things I really remember about that being in f	really	R	PREVB	tp
for us , just for the kids that really wanted to do something or like	really	R	PREVB	tp
ing what you see on TV because really it is because if you look at i	really	R	PREVB	tp
Yeah , oh , I mean , i- we didn't really play in the playground that mu	really	R	PREVB	tp
yn . Storefront loft , which was really nice at the time . Um . Where we	really	R	PREJJ	tp
if they're still around now , I really don't know . And what they teac	really	R	PREVB	tp
from my house . Yeah . That was really close , that was like you could	really	R	PREJJ	tp
the block ( laughing ) It wasn't really that far . We took a short bus	really	R	PREJJ	tp
e your last breath . Mm-mm . Not really . I'd say maybe ten years . Yeah	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ived in the black community . I really don't like you , and I'm not co	really	R	PREVB	tp
care . That's the way I felt . I really felt that way . I mean now I un	really	R	PREVB	tp
ut the only thing that I- that really stands out in my mind as far a	really	R	PREVB	tp
hat she was dating , um , it was really nothing to do but for a single	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ealize how many people they're really hurting from stealing from the	really	R	PREVB	tp
They don't care . I mean , they really a- I had picked Marion Barry u	really	R	PREVB	tp
nge things , and they did . They really did . Because < sigh > a lot of t	really	R	PREVB	tp
ther neighborhood they tore up really bad . I mean they went on up Ge	really	R	POSTVB	tp
uff . Like n- I can handle . Not really . I'll eat it . I don't have any	really	R	POSTVB	tp
But , in the same token , she is really the last one I have to worry a	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ew up in a time when I- when I really wanted to drive , my grandfathe	really	R	PREVB	tp
- they're serious . They have a really smart coaching staff , and I- a	really	R	NPAM	tp
w that , you know , they have a really good coaching staff , and I'm t	really	R	NPAM	tp
s- Their coaching- they have a really good coaching staff . And I kno	really	R	NPAM	tp
th him , and through time , it's really gonna pay off . Actually , this	really	R	PREVB	tp
Live . But , If I played it , and really got to learn , you know , you ha	really	R	PREVB	tp
now , due to the violence never really got the props it deserves . You	really	R	PREVB	tp
people around there that they really don't know , and- let ' em- you	really	R	PREVB	tp
m like , hey man , well , I never really used no tools . I'm like this m	really	R	PREVB	tp
more than anybody else if you really wanna look at it but I still r	really	R	PREVB	tp
t is- it- it was good . It- it- really , really . It- it- it was good .	really	R	POSTVB	tp
se , there's a problem . Because really , we didn't wanna really want y	really	R	PREVB	tp
ow . < laugh > So she did- My mom really turned her life around . Mm- I	really	R	PREVB	tp
nted more . And so , I didn't- I really didn't focus on racism . I knew	really	R	PREVB	tp
poke up . I spoke up . I'm like , really ? You- You don't have to take t	really	R	POSTVB	tp
like a motherfucker , bruh . It really was- it was cool , but it was l	really	R	PREVB	tp
niggas is having kids , bruh . I really can't . ( laughing ) I can't even	really	R	PREVB	tp

ut then . You know , I didn't- I really didn't have no social- my soci	really	R	PREVB	tp
are going through . But I can't really sympathize with ' em cause I'm-	really	R	PREVB	tp
So it was like , they couldn't really say s- too much , you know what	really	R	PREVB	tp
d everything , you know . But it really surprised me when Obama got hi	really	R	PREVB	tp
ey shouldn't be doing , and hey really nobody's spending time with th	really	R	PREVB	tp

Like god damn , I- I had- well really what was happening , I kept ski	really	R	PREVB	tp

l I got a little bit older and really realized their mission , until	really	R	PREVB	tp
ould race- At night , it wasn't really a- a shift . Whoever got to the	really	R	POSTVB	tp
negative so , they didn't never really have anything to say . It- it w	really	R	PREVB	tp

in your heart . When you don't really know a person's business , then	really	R	PREVB	tp
you can't tell people how you really feeling . And- and- and I- I wa	really	R	PREVB	tp
le better because this is not- really wasn't me . So um , and I was dr	really	R	PREVB	tp
nd then it was at one point , I really didn't know who I was , and I w	really	R	PREVB	tp
but it was a attitude that not really people- letting people know th	really	R	PREVB	tp
s um , kind of , < ts > um , Didn't really wanna go to Sunday school beca	really	R	PREVB	tp
and his dad , and that's when I really found hope- hope and stuff , so	really	R	PREVB	tp
thing would say stuff that she really didn't know that impacted my l	really	R	PREVB	tp
for- from their parents , they really don't even get it from the tea	really	R	PREVB	tp
were responsible for us , so we really could not go anywhere . Like I-	really	R	PREVB	tp
e was there , you know , so . Not really . Not really . Mm-hm . I was tomb	really	R	POSTVB	tp
p me in the house . I- I didn't really- I didn't- I didn't hang out t	really	R	PREVB	tp
ll of us slept in one bed , one really big bed . And I remember , < laug	really	R	NPAM	tp
se , never drove a car . Um , not really . Other than that , I had a aunt	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ut a thousand or so . There was really nothing over here . Everything	really	R	POSTVB	tp
tial reaction was white people really act how they act on TV . Like I	really	R	PREVB	tp
ght that was crazy . Cause they really talk like that . I- I never exp	really	R	PREVB	tp
high school . And I liked it . I really liked it . I really liked the a	really	R	PREVB	tp
with you , I never kn- I never really knew about Virginia until I w-	really	R	PREVB	tp
I don't know why , but I never really cared about what other people	really	R	PREVB	tp
r , but no I don't . < ts > I j- I really- I really don't have the time .	really	R	PREVB	tp
I really have to make time because I ha	really	R	PREVB	tp
have a favorite movie . I don't really have a favorite anything , but	really	R	PREVB	tp
that those are- those are not really suburban areas , but you have y	really	R	NPAM	tp
I mean , I don't know . I don't really think about it- football like	really	R	PREVB	tp
o like , it takes a village , it really was a village because , you kno	really	R	PREVB	tp
fferent people . One thing that really sticks out about high school i	really	R	PREVB	tp
African Americans . And I don't really know how I feel one way or ano	really	R	PREVB	tp
of the people I don't- I don't really wanna be associated with none	really	R	PREVB	tp
as before where we did- didn't really have as much because it was pr	really	R	PREVB	tp
it touches your soul . I can't really explain it , it's something you	really	R	PREVB	tp
Um , I'm a ex-wife and so I was really domestic for a long period of	really	R	PREJJ	tp
do know that Adams Morgan was really popular for different go go ba	really	R	PREJJ	tp
he song , so . I think there are really some talented people . Um , and	really	R	NPAM	tp
I really- I'm surprised that it didn't	really	R	PREJJ	tp
would have , because it's- it's really , uh , a unique genre of music .	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ng . Um , and- a- I- you know , I really- Morton's , Morton's Steakhouse	really	R	PREVB	tp
ole in the wall spots that are really really popular , um , in the cit	really	R	PREJJ	tp
actually nice too , so . It just really depends on the mood for me as	really	R	PREVB	tp
I can go to a mom and pop and really get some great food in DC . I-	really	R	PREVB	tp
one corner . Um , and it's- so I really would say like growing up , tho	really	R	PREVB	tp
re I went to high school , they really didn't go into DC because to t	really	R	PREVB	tp
ery dangerous at one point . It really was . Mm-hm . Uh-huh . Absolutely	really	R	PREVB	tp
introverted . And I think that really hurts them in terms of being c	really	R	PREVB	tp
bad as Southeast . So it wasn't really no transition . Like it would b	really	R	POSTVB	tp
That's all that we- We wasn't really into none of the crime or doin	really	R	POSTVB	tp
s play basketball . ? We wasn't really into doing anything negative .	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ross town . So uh , anything you really wanted to do you had to go acr	really	R	PREVB	tp
throw things like that , so we really kind of enjoyed going to schoo	really	R	PREVB	tp
iding the bus at the time so I really wouldn't know anything about t	really	R	PREVB	tp
< laugh > You know , So , I didn't really know what I was participating	really	R	PREVB	tp
type guy so it- it- it didn't really- it didn't really matter to me	really	R	PREVB	tp
t more . And- and that's when I really start realizing the word volun	really	R	PREVB	tp
f it- Those were the days were really you you either heard the fire	really	R	POSTVB	tp
now , and- and whatnot . So that really caught my interest then . And I	really	R	PREVB	tp
tle bit soon we woulda been in really serious trouble . And um , so th	really	R	NPAM	tp
. You know , so when people who really needed to get out , two more ho	really	R	PREVB	tp
alize the roots that this town really has . You know , I mean to be a	really	R	PREVB	tp
you know , and- and it's- it's really , to me , an honor you know , to	really	R	POSTVB	tp
mes when you think the town is really going under , you know , came ou	really	R	PREVB	tp
About five years the town was really really in a financial bind and	really	R	POSTVB	tp
st people felt like he weren't really concerned about the town and u	really	R	PREJJ	tp
r- I was finna say she didn't really never worked in the field . She	really	R	PREVB	tp
' t no dinner , no play . Oh , not really cause you know , I- I- I don't	really	R	POSTVB	tp
know , in class , self person . I really didn't do a lot of talking . I	really	R	PREVB	tp
at work , I'm down here so not really . Not really . Oh , I don't think	really	R	POSTVB	tp
, so . No . N- not really . Because , like I said , when I	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ah . When we have free time . We really don't have that much free time	really	R	PREVB	tp
mean people now- Don't nobody really wanna volunteer no more , so it	really	R	PREVB	tp
it- a lot of people now- I- I really look at the word volunteer . Yo	really	R	PREVB	tp
ome asleep . So , you know , they really don't miss me then cause they	really	R	PREVB	tp
there , so . I ain't playing . I really don't- I don't look at sports	really	R	PREVB	tp
st DC off of Benning Road . Not really , well yeah . < laugh > I went to	really	R	POSTVB	tp
foot- Like , basketball wasn't really my sport , and so I'd- I- I was	really	R	POSTVB	tp
say- say my older sisters were really focused on me too much . Like ,	really	R	PREJJ	tp
it was . U- I- No , I- I don't- really don't know what farm it was . M	really	R	PREVB	tp
, three levels . Yeah , it was a really big house . And- No , it didn't ,	really	R	NPAM	tp
hing . Um , but I say like , if I really think about it , majority of ou	really	R	PREVB	tp
candy for a quarter . Um , and I really miss that , but uh , we just wen	really	R	PREVB	tp
> the beat ( laughing ) . And you really don't understand what they act	really	R	PREVB	tp
n years old , and he's not even really into the streets . Like , he- he	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ting . And she was like , you're really good with words . Keep writing .	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ave been further back . I don't really remember . But I still have my	really	R	PREVB	tp
anded to them , and they're not really going to use it . N- Because I	really	R	PREVB	tp
e kind of older now . You don't really remember everything , so we not	really	R	PREVB	tp
mework , and he's like , I can't really help them because I don't real	really	R	PREVB	tp
tion at his job , so he doesn't really feel like he needs to go back ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
mean he does- He kind of does really well at his job , and he has a	really	R	POSTVB	tp
nce- everyone before me hasn't really had that experience . Like , my	really	R	PREVB	tp
over every year . And it wasn't really progressing . So , and then my m	really	R	PREVB	tp
oing other things that weren't really- But he's smart . He's a smart	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ships . In Maryland , they don't really have that . D- So , that's why I	really	R	PREVB	tp
ually saying . I- I- I- I- I really can't get it right now , but so	really	R	PREVB	tp
ike at the school , they didn't really care about their education . Li	really	R	PREVB	tp
ns . I'm like , but what can you really do for us ? And he was like , I	really	R	PREVB	tp
t . She really really wanted it . And I'm like , < ts >	really	R	PREVB	tp
teering committee . Because she really wanted it . She really wanted i	really	R	PREVB	tp
after . W- Like , when I started really knowing people , like when I re	really	R	PREVB	tp
s like , your maturity level is really high , so I went . We went to do	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ou know , I'm young . I- I don't really know what I'm talking about , b	really	R	PREVB	tp
heir energy- and my sister was really like , bold , and like nobody re	really	R	PREJJ	tp
l by myself , and people didn't really like my older sister . So then	really	R	PREVB	tp
lking- like , I started talking really early . And I started- she said	really	R	POSTVB	tp
Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . And she was really excited . Like , she was jumping	really	R	PREJJ	tp
way . And like- like , now she's really excited because she's finally	really	R	PREJJ	tp
d I think that's when I really really dove into like , my creative ex	really	R	PREVB	tp
ay < laugh > . She said she don't really know what happened , but she go	really	R	PREVB	tp
ut then you can find some that really- really care about kids . Reall	really	R	PREVB	tp
hat , you know , basically ain't really is not too much what we could	really	R	PREVB	tp
ause the adults at that school really wanted us to have respect for	really	R	PREVB	tp
. < laugh > So I don't think she really had that school in mind until	really	R	PREVB	tp
le . So I think that's how they really got over to Forestville . My da	really	R	PREVB	tp
t was a game . And I found that really weird if that's how you bring	really	R	PREJJ	tp
had three shots on goal and I really didn't know what I was doing .	really	R	PREVB	tp
a lot of people . < school > is a really big school . Uh , my graduating	really	R	NPAM	tp
e I'm able to focus and when I really need the help I'll aks my teac	really	R	PREVB	tp
it cause it's a lot of kids to really focus on , so the fact that kid	really	R	PREVB	tp
p to them and aks for help , it really helps them for real . Uh , I rea	really	R	PREVB	tp
he years . So like , we've never really wanted for anything . Each Chri	really	R	PREVB	tp
ver to < school > . And we didn't really talk . At- back track . We went	really	R	PREVB	tp
ol freshman year . But I didn't really start talking to her until lik	really	R	PREVB	tp
g s- community service which I really love to do . And being able to	really	R	PREVB	tp
sponsibility , cause no one has really stepped up to that responsibil	really	R	PREVB	tp
happy , so . If a day like that really comes which is like , a blue mo	really	R	PREVB	tp
n places where buildings don't really belong . I get that DC is heavi	really	R	PREVB	tp
at's a thing that you wouldn't really see in this type of neighborho	really	R	PREVB	tp
seum minimum twice , so I don't really have a great memory of ' em . Th	really	R	PREVB	tp
different things you wouldn't really see in your neighborhood per s	really	R	PREVB	tp
d chicken . And maybe if you're really feeling it , you put ' em on you	really	R	PREVB	tp
of mumbo sauce . I don't under- really understand how to s- describe	really	R	PREVB	tp
That's smothering it . And you really take away the taste of the chi	really	R	PREVB	tp
ple hate me for it but I don't really listen to go go music . I don't	really	R	PREVB	tp
laces . It was like Georgia but really can't say Georgia , cause I thi	really	R	PREVB	tp
eing a clown . Being a- No , not really a class clown , but you know , j	really	R	POSTVB	tp
laying softball . What ? When we really really started hanging . Yeah .	really	R	PREVB	tp
we- we knew each other . But we really got close when we started play	really	R	PREVB	tp
. Call him Uncle < name > but he really is my cousin . And way back the	really	R	PREVB	tp
yeah- I didn't- well , I didn't really kn- know that much of my mom's	really	R	PREVB	tp
at me . And it- it made me feel really bad so they hold really high s	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ed me before . He's never like , really yelled at me before , but one t	really	R	PREVB	tp
o , because my grandparents are really in my life , and um- I'm really	really	R	POSTVB	tp
. And , um , School . Right . When really all the farming was done , but	really	R	PREVB	tp
go to school because c- school really didn't open for us til about ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
a lot of those black kids they really had to stay and work on the fa	really	R	PREVB	tp
- Speed r- I mean , Princeville really didn't have ? many stores , you	really	R	PREVB	tp
t I could cook , I did it , so I really started when I was about eight	really	R	PREVB	tp
n tobacco and stuff like- So I really had to , uh , look out for the y	really	R	PREVB	tp
d did not plan . And so I- I- I really honestly believe that sometime	really	R	PREVB	tp
ave gone through , because I- I really feel that there have been some	really	R	PREVB	tp
c school arena . And so I would really like to explore what it would	really	R	PREVB	tp
ontinues to this day . And I- I really feel that through all the diff	really	R	PREVB	tp
t went well are- are ones that really really stick out . Well , there	really	R	PREVB	tp
I don't feel like you- you can really be cognizant of what's going o	really	R	PREVB	tp
s pretty much it . Because I- I really wasn't , um , I wasn't really in	really	R	PREVB	tp
hand and I- I didn't know , y- really the difference between a Corni	really	R	POSTVB	tp
had a- uh , a lot of people who really , uh , were all about the studen	really	R	PREVB	tp
versight that really helped to you know , shape and	really	R	PREVB	tp
d , uh , where we went . And I- I really think that it was , uh , their o	really	R	PREVB	tp
his is family . And like , we're really big on family , whereas when I	really	R	PREJJ	tp
he morning , and they have this really old restaurant called Macadoos	really	R	NPAM	tp
t something like that would of really happened , and I'm just like , w	really	R	PREVB	tp
eople everywhere , never had to really worry about my race . Like I- I	really	R	PREVB	tp
cher called her , and we didn't really talk about it again- about the	really	R	PREVB	tp
e is it ? Um , so that- that was really rough for me . And it's- it's s	really	R	PREJJ	tp
are you ? And it's like , do we really live in a society where we hav	really	R	PREVB	tp
h writing that paper that I- I really came to resonate with my ident	really	R	PREVB	tp
stoops . Um , and there was this really big playground behind my grand	really	R	NPAM	tp
ack there . Um , but there was a really big playground , and it had thi	really	R	NPAM	tp
ady's house . Um , and that's- I really miss the candy lady's house . U	really	R	PREVB	tp
uccessful . Um , And I- and that really made me excited cause I said ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
e of it and I should not be , I really don't have a reason to be here	really	R	PREVB	tp
m- mainly black teachers that really influenced me too , and oh yeah	really	R	PREVB	tp
lose half of her face ? Did she really have to go out like that ? Just	really	R	PREVB	tp
nship , it's just that he never really worked towards having a g- goo	really	R	PREVB	tp
was two years old . So I don't really remember him not being in my l	really	R	PREVB	tp
the way they- And we couldn't really understand what he was saying .	really	R	PREVB	tp
ike a family thing . So , um , we really couldn't understand my dad chu	really	R	PREVB	tp
ionship . And it wasn't until I really got older , probably like high	really	R	PREVB	tp
ds chirping . All older people , really no kids on my block . And as I	really	R	POSTVB	tp
it was gang affiliated , but it really wasn't . So this was a time whe	really	R	PREVB	tp
and you might wanna ch- . But I really wasn't in a gang , it was just-	really	R	PREVB	tp
oks as I was younger , I wasn't really into the streets , wasn't havin	really	R	POSTVB	tp
all , y'all can stay on campus really get the feel of what it is . So	really	R	PREVB	tp
g the yard . They were the ones really doing stuff for the youth . So	really	R	PREVB	tp
name , it's about what they're really doing on campus and in the com	really	R	PREVB	tp
n awhile because people wasn't really doing other things , and so onc	really	R	PREVB	tp
a lot of stuff like , you can't really get away on her cause l- she-	really	R	PREVB	tp
just a little bit , but no , not really . I had a good time . It was ama	really	R	POSTVB	tp
took us to his neighborhood to really show us . No . Yeah . < laugh > And	really	R	PREVB	tp
ff the chain . Off the chain . I really don't know cause I feel like s	really	R	PREVB	tp
Uh-huh . I'm'a try it . < laugh > Really ? Probably not . Mm-hm . But I fe	really	R	POSTVB	tp
hat was my sweet sixteen gift . Really- < laugh > So , I'm not gonna say	really	R	PREVB	tp
my relationships . Like you are really spoiled . Like you really think	really	R	PREJJ	tp
own , work . < laugh > It very- It really is . Mm-hm . You younger , he- Ok	really	R	PREVB	tp
say people envied it , but they really just didn't like me . So like ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
k . Like , it was- it- if people really hated it- And it's just so fun	really	R	PREVB	tp
ause I don't like being hot . I really hate being hot , and I didn't t	really	R	PREVB	tp
r . I'm talking about like , you really don't want to dress dress up b	really	R	PREVB	tp
Like that . And so um , < ts > it really took a toll on us because < nam	really	R	PREVB	tp
ed to speak . I feel like I was really at a good space in my life , an	really	R	POSTVB	tp
to keep like , replaying , and I really had to see a psychiatrist on W	really	R	PREVB	tp
field I took up because I had really wanted to be a CPA . < laugh > An	really	R	PREVB	tp
e back . And , um , I felt that I really had a story to share with a lo	really	R	PREVB	tp
f your space and like , look , I really- this is what I need to do , an	really	R	PREVB	tp
I'm- but I'm gonna do it , I am really focused on getting a degree be	really	R	PREJJ	tp
of the womanizer , though he's really a incredible dork . This- like ,	really	R	POSTVB	tp
n Washington < ts > and that was really cool cause we'd sung with Chri	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ere some of my classmates were really starting to be like , oh , like ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
as the first time I've felt- I really felt- I really felt like I fit	really	R	PREVB	tp
. Have you- Soylent Green is a really good one . Like , I would- I wou	really	R	NPAM	tp
t was a bunch of stuff . It was really , really good . Um , and that's a	really	R	PREJJ	tp
. And it's like- like she- she really saw my struggle to like , not-	really	R	PREVB	tp
e's this thing that's gonna be really affecting DC heavily , um , in a	really	R	PREVB	tp
ds . Like , f- it's- it- if it's really this thing , like it's gonna be	really	R	POSTVB	tp
e type of parallels are what I really live for . Um , maybe it's somet	really	R	PREVB	tp
also on me too . Like , I didn't really mean that . Um , I was just frus	really	R	PREVB	tp
inking to myself , damn I would really like to have a beer with my da	really	R	PREVB	tp
two thousand one that I start really hitting my- my stride as the H	really	R	PREVB	tp
t . I don't like funerals . I- I really don't like funerals . They're-	really	R	PREVB	tp
t- Um , < ts > let's see . I don't really- I can't really say because um	really	R	POSTVB	tp
e can- I can have a one on one really with the teacher . Not like- no	really	R	POSTVB	tp
my classes I have- I work . I'm really not into like , working at nigh	really	R	POSTVB	tp
is < ts > um , go go was always a really aggressive music , um , and so t	really	R	NPAM	tp
you base it out of . But that's really like the make up of uh , uh , uh	really	R	POSTVB	tp
t the dyke in here . But it was really later later on . Yeah . It was a	really	R	PREJJ	tp
t area . And then the- the next really huge flood that I can remember	really	R	NPAM	tp
aside for me because I wasn't really , you know , concentrating on it	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ent to < school > . So that- I- I really need the flexibility and th- a	really	R	PREVB	tp
Our general funds were looking really good . I mean , we were- Let me	really	R	PREJJ	tp
lling me to let me know that I really need to get serious and get my	really	R	PREVB	tp
I almost picked her up . Cause really in the back of my heart , it ha	really	R	PREVB	tp
, I- like I say , the flood , it really never t- dawned on me how deva	really	R	PREVB	tp
, what busses we got- We don't really need it because we're big on i	really	R	PREVB	tp
ot to high school , they didn't really have beef anymore , but they we	really	R	PREVB	tp
fferent locations , this sounds really interesting . I went to < school	really	R	PREJJ	tp
very couple of years , um , this really intense moment of intimacy . Um	really	R	NPAM	tp
like couple of hours for it to really hit you all the way . So he was	really	R	PREVB	tp
e juice behind it cause it was really nasty , right ? So once you drin	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ck cocaine . You know , I wasn't really smoking any more reefer at tha	really	R	PREVB	tp
ng it . So I kept smoking it , I really didn't- didn't- didn't- didn't	really	R	PREVB	tp
pt it from him . And by him not really knowing what was going on , uh ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
to get our heroin . Uh , so she really didn't know- know , uh , what we	really	R	PREVB	tp
e she didn't really understand the nature of what	really	R	PREVB	tp
she wasn't um- she- she didn't really try to stop it you know becaus	really	R	PREVB	tp
now they weren't- they weren't really asking anybody for anything th	really	R	PREVB	tp
- that was a big thing , my mom really was hurt by him- him being ass	really	R	PREJJ	tp
retty much , uh , everything was really really good you know and uh , t	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ther . And um , they weren't really close they kind of like went t	really	R	PREJJ	tp
rothers they weren't really close but they did things toge	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ars older than I was they were really close . And uh , my oldest two b	really	R	PREJJ	tp
have to cause there's nothing really in Princeville you know , to ge	really	R	POSTVB	tp
o many people- and that's when really everybody rallied you know , to	really	R	PREVB	tp
' t know what it's like until I really got hired at < work > what it wa	really	R	PREVB	tp
t's not- it's- it's no where I really wanna stay . You know , but I li	really	R	PREVB	tp
as Carolina , you know , Duke is really not that far so we're in a goo	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ometime it sad when they don't really use it to their advantage . You	really	R	PREVB	tp
, uh , performing , and I wasn't really living anywhere . I was just ki	really	R	PREVB	tp
ling from a stroke , and so not really working right now . < ts > Okay .	really	R	PREVB	tp
Like that was real cool . Um , I really enjoyed having s- all that fam	really	R	PREVB	tp
just doing stuff that I didn't really care for . So , yeah . And hm , I	really	R	PREVB	tp
ut for like two years before I really ever played it right ? This was	really	R	PREVB	tp
s one of those things we don't really talk about . And yeah like- lik	really	R	PREVB	tp
. I remember that . Um , she was really excited when he proposed , and	really	R	PREJJ	tp
we all were really excited for her too . Um , and w	really	R	PREJJ	tp
thing like that . It's always a really intense like , moment of togeth	really	R	NPAM	tp
t know . And- an- It- it hadn't really hit me . I was attending the me	really	R	PREVB	tp
anyway . But , uh , it- that was really the most devastating point . A	really	R	POSTVB	tp
t , um , I- everything that I- I really can recall or rules and things	really	R	PREVB	tp
ene was um , it- it w- it was a really fun scene . You know , females a	really	R	NPAM	tp
re in a club and it's like not really a lot of room whatsoever . And	really	R	POSTVB	tp
use . Tell you the truth , it's really no difference because Maryland	really	R	POSTVB	tp
know what I'm saying we don't really affiliate ourself with Baltimo	really	R	PREVB	tp
And um , you know , I mean they really didn't get along cause anybody	really	R	PREVB	tp
and was in DC their whole life really didn't consider Maryland being	really	R	PREVB	tp
now I mean i- it's- it- it was really no different to me you know wh	really	R	PREJJ	tp
know what I'm saying you don't really indulge in that too much but y	really	R	PREVB	tp
ve around Southview . Southview really didn't change too much other t	really	R	PREVB	tp
hing . It's a lot of stuff that really really changed in DC from what	really	R	PREVB	tp
from < school > or < school > . Not really sure if they even graduated or	really	R	PREJJ	tp
was wild . Yeah , I never got to really tell him how I felt about him .	really	R	PREVB	tp
you on crack I guess you ain't really thinking about too much . You k	really	R	PREVB	tp
Maryland , you know like- me I really couldn't tell cause it was jus	really	R	PREVB	tp
n come , I would do that . Um , I really- stopped really doing Christma	really	R	PREVB	tp
. And my sister in VA , I don't really get to see her whatsoever . It '	really	R	PREVB	tp
specially my father , my father really wanted a dude to play with any	really	R	PREVB	tp
d my females , and uh , he ain't really trip off of me being in the ho	really	R	PREVB	tp
t was real funny but they were really protective of they- uh , grandm	really	R	PREJJ	tp
rk , all that . You know we were really close . And uh , he had another	really	R	PREJJ	tp
er , my aunts- un- uncles never really showed up unless you know what	really	R	PREVB	tp
o come see Chuck , you wouldn't really see the- too many white people	really	R	PREVB	tp
nd stuff like that that wasn't really they scene but it was so unive	really	R	POSTVB	tp
verybody's out to take . Nobody really wants to give . But , you fight	really	R	PREVB	tp
nts to prove for what reason I really don't know , whatever's going o	really	R	PREVB	tp
now . That's how close we were , really . Cause when you live on Fifth	really	R	POSTVB	tp
de all the time . < ts > I didn't really start to really feel that unti	really	R	PREVB	tp
anna back- Right . But it's not really because it's- it's a jump , but	really	R	POSTVB	tp
rselves to a- some degree- Not really , she paid o- She made- We alwa	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ough you . Once you hear it you really can't stay still . The congos i	really	R	PREVB	tp
g in the chair dead and nobody really knew it . Um , so as the years w	really	R	PREVB	tp
w , people in other areas don't really use those terms when they talk	really	R	PREVB	tp
days it's cold . Somedays it's really cold . And the next day might b	really	R	PREJJ	tp
day one , man . I mean , I don't really care why they like it , you kno	really	R	PREVB	tp
m saying . But I ain't- I ain't really too worried about that . I ain '	really	R	PREJJ	tp
first question first , I don't really do it for them to help me out .	really	R	PREVB	tp
derstand you clearly . Man , I'm really so lost in the question . You s	really	R	PREJJ	tp
cess is- I don't even think he really touched the surface yet . As- a	really	R	PREVB	tp
so trendy , but , you know , you really do gotta trust your process . Y	really	R	PREVB	tp
day , artist at night . I mean , really- it's really what we define mu	really	R	POSTVB	tp
home with us more . Um , I don't really I remember having a babysitter	really	R	PREVB	tp
ere til I left for college . So really became- I don't wanna say a fa	really	R	PREVB	tp
her , but the loss of her , was really difficult . on the family , on-	really	R	PREJJ	tp
y yes . Mm , no . No . < laugh > Not really . I- I didn't not like it , but	really	R	POSTVB	tp
n't have- Oh- I don't remember really doing any extracurricular acti	really	R	PREVB	tp
we brought out the xylophones , really liked the xylophones . ( laughin	really	R	PREVB	tp
ok of things on the outside is really what changes people's minds . B	really	R	POSTVB	tp
, it's great . It's- it's- it's really good that she don't- they don '	really	R	PREJJ	tp
randma house , be like , is this really true ? Cause I remember when we	really	R	PREJJ	tp
en I was thirteen and I didn't really have nowhere to go , but I had	really	R	PREVB	tp
s it . Oh yes . I l- I- I wasn't really crazy about it but they had a	really	R	PREJJ	tp
of this house . And I was like , really ? She was like , I remember comi	really	R	POSTVB	tp
verything . And uh , I was like , really ? It's like , you came through ,	really	R	POSTVB	tp
something that- really they can say , I went to Prince	really	R	PREVB	tp
you look at like , we- God has really blessed us that the kids have	really	R	PREVB	tp
look in and I'm like , God . We really moved up . We really moved up .	really	R	PREVB	tp
before , you woulda been like , really ? And the- Actually , our old to	really	R	POSTVB	tp
A lot of people in Princeville really didn't- you hadn't- some peopl	really	R	PREVB	tp
o didn't get flooded . Downtown really did , but it wasn't as bad as P	really	R	PREVB	tp
e , okay . Is- is this- are they really serious ? But < ts > it was like-	really	R	PREJJ	tp
' s just no something that just really like , I mean we always- we got	really	R	PREVB	tp
nning her wedding . So I didn't really learn a lot and like , I just w	really	R	PREVB	tp
ing- helping a seller I wasn't really a a s- s- you know actual sell	really	R	POSTVB	tp
go . It's a little of this , and really good Mumbo ? Nobody knows what-	really	R	NPAM	tp
s go to Tarboro High School to really see how blessed we were by bei	really	R	PREVB	tp
ng for nine months . And it- it really wore me out , but I'm just glad	really	R	PREVB	tp
that they have in there . And I really think she should be mayor , but	really	R	PREVB	tp
hat's on the town council that really pushes and drives for Princevi	really	R	PREVB	tp
treet . A lot of people- it- it really messed a lot of people up . It	really	R	PREVB	tp
k that with- with the flood it really messed a lot of people up , not	really	R	PREVB	tp
onna get anything you know uh , really out of life until they decide	really	R	POSTVB	tp
aith you know and so r- I r- I really pretty much model myself to- a	really	R	PREVB	tp
my- my purpose in life is like really reaching out to help people , g	really	R	PREVB	tp
achelors degree . Somebody that really even counted themselves out fe	really	R	PREVB	tp
the teams I really root for . You know , New Orlean	really	R	PREVB	tp
skins I look at teams that are really struggling , you know those are	really	R	PREVB	tp
ried Chicken . You know I'm not really sure but Hot Shoppes Jr. was-	really	R	PREJJ	tp
even having anywhere to go . We really couldn't drive anywhere w- but	really	R	PREVB	tp
you know , that's what go go- I really- But- but it's- it's- it's- it	really	R	PREVB	tp
s Presley too . So I really wanted to be uh , a rock star ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
toward the end of the show , I really uh- and plus I knew about Elvi	really	R	PREVB	tp
. And even today you know I- I really- it really disheartens me to s	really	R	PREVB	tp
ople like W.E.B. Du Bois and I really found out that he- he had- he	really	R	PREVB	tp
h , they gave us hope . I wasn't really into the Black Panther movemen	really	R	POSTVB	tp
, you know , so James Brown was really uh , uh , instrumental in giving	really	R	POSTVB	tp
oud . Those are the things that really fueled us and gave us you know	really	R	PREVB	tp
let's go over here . Well- but really that to me was like , he just c	really	R	PREVB	tp
' em nobody bo- and they didn't really have anything so nobody bother	really	R	PREVB	tp
othing else available but they really like the wine so we would watc	really	R	PREVB	tp
n ninety eight to- eight years really . Nineteen ninety eight to two	really	R	POSTVB	tp
dope and then get the dope not really feeling normal , you know once	really	R	PREVB	tp
n't know doing things that you really don't approve of , and you're l	really	R	PREVB	tp
hat was when the go go era was really starting because they had grou	really	R	PREVB	tp
idered ECU local because I was really dead set on not leaving my gra	really	R	PREJJ	tp
hes me because I know that she really wanted me to finish , but I als	really	R	PREVB	tp
one , I kn- know that she would really want me to move away and go on	really	R	PREVB	tp
. Um , and it's just time , it's really time , so . Business administrat	really	R	POSTVB	tp
this organization , but it just really depends on where we are as a o	really	R	PREVB	tp
> To be a CEO . Um , but it just really depends on- on the organizatio	really	R	PREVB	tp
e with our restructuring , that really depends on my future here at t	really	R	PREVB	tp
once . Um , because the children really make me get it . Like when I se	really	R	PREVB	tp
ectively as I should be . And I really want to . So , one thing that I '	really	R	PREVB	tp
to me , but . You know , I'm- I'm really proactive about making myself	really	R	PREJJ	tp
w up in . Uh , my grandmother is really really heavily into politics ,	really	R	PREJJ	tp
vily involved in it because he really believed in what Obama stood f	really	R	PREVB	tp
now , they're gonna do what- He really made people believe that your	really	R	PREVB	tp
y mama . So , ( laughing ) he just really energized the whole city and h	really	R	PREVB	tp
e're Redskin fever . But I just really would like to see them give us	really	R	PREVB	tp
oles , and it's ridiculous . Not really . I think with growing up in Pr	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ss . I hate to say it , but they really need to go on and let Tarboro	really	R	PREVB	tp
because I really see it happening . I mean if th	really	R	PREVB	tp
king Princeville over . There's really nothing I can- can do about it	really	R	POSTVB	tp
visiting them because there's really nothing to do here . Mm-hm . But	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ally , that's it . And you would really be shocked that people hang ou	really	R	PREVB	tp
f in two days . A lot of people really look forward to Fridays becaus	really	R	PREVB	tp
Mm-mm . I mean cause m- people really had their minds pretty much ma	really	R	PREVB	tp
nd power lines , that's when it really hit me that okay , everything i	really	R	PREVB	tp
eople . I don't know why . She's really scary , but she loves dead peop	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ng in Criminology . I think she really wants to do forensic science .	really	R	PREVB	tp
ister , her daughter and I were really close because all of us stayed	really	R	PREJJ	tp
water . So I don't understand . Really if you go in parts of East Tar	really	R	PREVB	tp
that they're doing . I haven't really been in there but once or twic	really	R	PREVB	tp
for that adults but the adults really should know better . And- they '	really	R	PREVB	tp
wn now . My first love is um- I really wanna be a wardrobe stylist fo	really	R	PREVB	tp
m . She- Yeah , she did . She was really pressed that- And was just lik	really	R	PREVB	tp
when you- when you- when it's really your time , you gotta- y- you g	really	R	POSTVB	tp
redit when credit due . Like he really talking about something . So I '	really	R	PREVB	tp
what I'm saying . I'm not gonna really release all my m- my strategie	really	R	PREVB	tp
ot of kids don't really get that , I mean now . Because	really	R	PREVB	tp
se I feel like my community is really what made me who I am . And a l	really	R	POSTVB	tp
o home , you know . And it's not really many of those around here . I m	really	R	POSTVB	tp
e a big family , and they don't really get that anymore cause it's so	really	R	PREVB	tp
s growing and they don't know- really know the meaning of community	really	R	PREVB	tp
' m like a people person , and I really really enjoy helping people , a	really	R	PREVB	tp
in when the bullet wasn't even really meant for him . And so . Yeah . A	really	R	PREVB	tp
over a new leaf now . He ain't really even into it . Which most of th	really	R	POSTVB	tp
nd so he was the only one that really got in trouble for it . But he	really	R	PREVB	tp
kind of started it aren't even really into it anymore . It's these li	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ey think it's a joke , and they really taking Princeville and turn it	really	R	PREVB	tp
like it used to be . It's- it's really not . You got those guys that g	really	R	POSTVB	tp
he stays . I- I didn't- I don't really- I didn't really know her unti	really	R	PREVB	tp
Princeville . Long Pine is not really that bad . Lakeside is terrible	really	R	PREJJ	tp
' s not even that serious . It's really not . They- < laugh > It's like-	really	R	POSTVB	tp
d then you got the people that really were- the people that were gro	really	R	PREVB	tp
was such- you know , it wasn't really a big school when I was there .	really	R	POSTVB	tp
me , you had everybody there to really help one another . And like , wh	really	R	PREVB	tp
d- cause a lot of people don't really know . And so that song pretty	really	R	PREVB	tp
e chosen . And so I mean I just really read the Bible , ideas come int	really	R	PREVB	tp
they would probably send me a really big tuition bill , Um , I wasn't	really	R	NPAM	tp
it was around that time I was really grappling with , Yeah , art thin	really	R	PREVB	tp
ence of what that- You know it really mean- Yeah . Yup . Yup . Yup . Mm-	really	R	PREVB	tp
nna like me . And I ain't gonna really care cause at that point I don	really	R	PREVB	tp
it's probably the first time I really looked at me and started to se	really	R	PREVB	tp
> , and said , hey Ms. < name > , I really wanna start this peer mediatio	really	R	PREVB	tp
one time right now , so I don't really have time for eighty one . And	really	R	PREVB	tp
t it is the most- I can't even really think of the word . It's the mo	really	R	PREVB	tp
it t- it took me until now to really see that . And what I think abo	really	R	PREVB	tp
t- Yeah . I mean , growing up , I really didn't know as much . I mean I	really	R	PREVB	tp
blame it . And you knew she was really saying the other word , but she	really	R	PREVB	tp
didn't really appreciate Princeville as much	really	R	PREVB	tp
to Princeville that do- didn't really grow up there and didn't reall	really	R	PREVB	tp
ady a dangerous guy . So when I really get that- a team that work jus	really	R	PREVB	tp
hen I be really feeling like , you ain't my com	really	R	PREVB	tp
uh , you the only artist that I really feel like is the competition w	really	R	PREVB	tp
ng something this year . It was really just focusing on it and gettin	really	R	PREVB	tp
he way . So I- my focus was not really tryna put so much attention on	really	R	PREVB	tp
them as well , so . Um , I don't really think it's a thing that's too	really	R	PREVB	tp
is real . I mean , it's- that's really what it is , from the music to	really	R	POSTVB	tp
e I'm at with it . Um , nah , not really . I tried dumbing it down , but	really	R	POSTVB	tp
Especially in this area . It's really fun . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Y	really	R	PREJJ	tp
out to celebrate it . It's just really beautiful to see people in lov	really	R	PREJJ	tp
a household where they weren't really parents because they were gran	really	R	POSTVB	tp
d of- < ts > I grew up with this really kind of older world view . Uh ,	really	R	PREJJ	tp
e , that people say they didn't really know was a DC term . But th- ye	really	R	PREVB	tp
then , you know , nobody- nobody really , you know , wanted to say it , b	really	R	PREVB	tp
crew that was in the north was really just- they were around more sc	really	R	POSTVB	tp
nch of us that's like , there's really no difference . I- I m- I may h	really	R	POSTVB	tp
e , I love it here , I was like , really ? Like , man I'm trying to go to	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ff , you know it . The part that really gets me is that , okay , < ts > le	really	R	PREVB	tp
cause come on , be real , if you really wanted to keep people in your	really	R	PREVB	tp
don't think that anybody ever really took the time to- to give them	really	R	PREVB	tp
< ts > I- you know what , I don't really- I don't really think that the	really	R	PREVB	tp
d all these racial issues that really isn't- Like honestly < exhale >	really	R	PREVB	tp
om the outside coming in don't really get that . So I don't think it '	really	R	PREVB	tp
ing almost extreme for them to really mess with you . Because people	really	R	PREVB	tp
-Eleven . So it's not- it's not really black and white it's like , mor	really	R	PREJJ	tp
se , the- the caterer was like , really , really upsetting . Um , it's pr	really	R	PREJJ	tp
people that's there that don't really know , you know , what it mean .	really	R	PREVB	tp
ople in Princeville that don't really know what it is to be a reside	really	R	PREVB	tp
ve a lot of caring people that really , you know , mold and make who y	really	R	PREVB	tp
to private school , I was just really behind and I had to get a tuto	really	R	PREJJ	tp
se or anything like that , so I really truly have been blessed . Truly	really	R	PREVB	tp
to college in New York cause I really love New York City but , um , my	really	R	PREVB	tp
- if the drummer tight , he can really like , carry the show . But I me	really	R	PREVB	tp
e drums cause you can- you can really- they- you can really get off	really	R	PREVB	tp
ut tents too sometime . Mm , not really . Cause I know I- my- When I le	really	R	POSTVB	tp
the flood you know , they- they really have . But- But- ? Yeah . but- w	really	R	PREVB	tp
ion . What did I do ? Well I was really , uh , combat soldier . I w- I- I	really	R	POSTVB	tp
s- Well in Illinois . It wasn't really St. Louis . But we m- I lived i	really	R	POSTVB	tp
growing up like that , I had to really make sure that um , I had a fai	really	R	PREVB	tp
h of my own in God , and that's really one of the strong points in my	really	R	POSTVB	tp
we kind of had a gap . We don't really- we didn't really play togethe	really	R	PREVB	tp
nlight . I'm just in here . So I really feel bad for kids now having a	really	R	PREVB	tp
gate now in PG County , and she really is kind of like a Joe Clarke .	really	R	PREVB	tp
cause the school wasn't like- really struggling , and she came in an	really	R	PREVB	tp
I- I- I- my rhythm , I couldn't really keep- I couldn't keep going wi	really	R	PREVB	tp
d like , really cracked the whip . Um , yeah . Ye	really	R	PREVB	tp
gonna become something that I really did a lot of , but at the time ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
es and writing . Um , so she was really really really great . And then	really	R	PREJJ	tp
uh , Mr. < name > , < name > . And he really helped me get- cause I love co	really	R	PREVB	tp
- yeah I was like , there's not really much to give you there . Um , < t	really	R	POSTVB	tp
m , < ts > so in term- so there's really unfortunately not that much ne	really	R	POSTVB	tp
And that's when I started um , really paying attention in church , st	really	R	PREVB	tp
e were the days when I started really walking in- in my faith with t	really	R	PREVB	tp
is college . < school > was- was really great . I loved it cause you co	really	R	PREJJ	tp
um , uh , Jonah in the Bible . He really hated the Ninevites . I can't s	really	R	PREVB	tp
thousand thirteen , God started really moving on my heart to give me	really	R	PREVB	tp
r in DC , but Miss < name > would really really- used to encourage me w	really	R	PREVB	tp
ff or something . I ain't never really good- I- I played the trumpet	really	R	PREJJ	tp
the trumpet but I ain't never really was good at no drums . Oh , okay	really	R	PREVB	tp
able to get a beat ??. I never really like invested in it . You playe	really	R	PREVB	tp
ave never happened had you not really instigated this . It didn't rea	really	R	PREVB	tp
e > we need you to come , you're really good talking with the people .	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ecause they said , well , you're really good talking to people because	really	R	PREJJ	tp
a do it anymore . So- but I got really good at it . So I said I'm just	really	R	PREJJ	tp
cluded . Um , and it was- it was really good for me to just be there f	really	R	PREJJ	tp
orth it . I was like , you can't really put a price tag or a convenien	really	R	PREVB	tp
like it's a fairytale , when it really should be the opposite . You sh	really	R	PREVB	tp
f being back home . Because you really can't- I don't recommend peopl	really	R	PREVB	tp
ves first . So , that worked out really well , but it took me about a g	really	R	POSTVB	tp
will give me a good excuse to really go out and tour and see things	really	R	PREVB	tp
get out of here . Like I didn't really feel like it . I mean , I had fr	really	R	PREVB	tp
environment and you ? couldn't really have any emotion . You really c	really	R	PREVB	tp
the mortuary , Mr. < name > . Uh , really feisty Italian man , I loved hi	really	R	NPAM	tp
ike that , < ts > nothing you can really do with them . Um , so we would	really	R	PREVB	tp
was- it was nothing you could really do . So then it would be my job	really	R	PREVB	tp
no more . < laugh > < ts > No , not really . I was- yeah , I was like every	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ere like , everywhere . I didn't really get into like , rep- I couldn't	really	R	PREVB	tp
urthest . Baltimore , they don't really know what you're talking about	really	R	PREVB	tp
culture of this place ? I don't really think that's a factor to them	really	R	PREVB	tp
the parents have the money to really pay , you know , a- a- um , membe	really	R	PREVB	tp
g environments where a kid can really be a kid , basically . I did . < l	really	R	PREVB	tp
ton , Potomac , you know , it was really estate-y type , um , complex . Yo	really	R	NPAM	tp
on't never see them , I haven't really met them . But I know I got , yo	really	R	PREVB	tp
an . Only , you know , us can see really eye to eye , understand what's	really	R	PREJJ	tp
aid I'm just starting , I don't really have the big equipment , you kn	really	R	PREVB	tp
and tight ? Cau- cause it's not really a y- a , you know , a neighborho	really	R	POSTVB	tp
p in Northeast because- it was really- really full circle . Um , remem	really	R	PREJJ	tp
said it was really no reason for you to taunt thi	really	R	POSTVB	tp
when we moved to DC . So it was really full circle . Sometimes God doe	really	R	PREJJ	tp
before , but nine . And it was a really busy street , it's- it's on < ad	really	R	NPAM	tp
my- after my sophomore year , I really fell in love with the school .	really	R	PREVB	tp
And I- I really began to , you know , challenge	really	R	PREVB	tp
r I just graduated , um , wasn't really search- um , this is when like ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
the economy was really , you know , it was like , uh- it	really	R	POSTVB	tp
right ? And I- I mean , I wasn't really stressing it too , cause I had ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
now what , your neighborhood is really like a village . Like , you know	really	R	POSTVB	tp
up . That does- that d- that is really- that f- like imagine like jus	really	R	POSTVB	tp
es and stuff like that . And it really hit me when I was leaving one	really	R	PREVB	tp
itressing . This is when it was really hitting me . I'm looking for wa	really	R	PREVB	tp
our dumbass on the ground like really do some big bama shit , you kno	really	R	PREVB	tp
r my freshman year , I actually really considered transferring . From	really	R	PREVB	tp
m for me , too . So e- it's just really the discipline at this point ,	really	R	POSTVB	tp
be- you- it takes strength to really like , restrain . And I don't- T	really	R	PREVB	tp
at's for anybody . Like I don't really know all the things that's in	really	R	PREVB	tp
t are perceived to be good but really not ? Um , well I just seen the	really	R	POSTVB	tp
s . Yeah . Uh , see , I don't even really know now but I know it's been	really	R	PREVB	tp
hat grew up together are still really really close . We consider each	really	R	PREJJ	tp
or- is the prime example- I've really have a big problem with them b	really	R	PREVB	tp
razy , but I- I- I trust ' em . I really do , and I know that they will	really	R	PREVB	tp
ciate it a lot more . And uh , I really do . But , they don't . It's sad .	really	R	PREVB	tp
e different things . Cause I- I really feel like the power is- is the	really	R	PREVB	tp
t really affect me is the point of what	really	R	PREVB	tp
yself , so , I- that- that don't really affect me . People beliefs don '	really	R	PREVB	tp
r or something . And I couldn't really understand what they was talki	really	R	PREVB	tp
orking in the kitchen . Like , I really had the choice every day to ea	really	R	PREVB	tp
years , you know , campus like really , really became like , yeah wow ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
, like you really people that come from outside ,	really	R	POSTVB	tp
er thought of color or- I just really do- didn't . Like I was that's	really	R	PREVB	tp
Mm-hm . Gotcha . < ts > I don't s- really foresee this I just wanna make	really	R	PREVB	tp
ter that Hyattsville , which is really close , so primarily Prince Geo	really	R	PREJJ	tp
or four years old and I wasn't really exposed to , um , well at least	really	R	PREVB	tp
om my knowledge , that I wasn't really exposed to- um , < ts > I think i	really	R	PREJJ	tp
o be real hot , when we used to really have heat waves , We turn on th	really	R	PREVB	tp
n't that m- the race was never really a issue like that . In regards	really	R	POSTVB	tp
me growing- growing up , when I really began to be conscious of , you	really	R	PREVB	tp
< name > . And , um , you know , she really spoke to her about this and th	really	R	PREVB	tp
e I didn't know- practically I really didn't know anybody there , so .	really	R	PREVB	tp
new school where I practically really don't know anybody at all . And	really	R	PREVB	tp
hth grade though , I was , um , I really challenged myself to , you know	really	R	PREVB	tp
now , at < school > that's when I really- I knew I wanted to go to coll	really	R	PREVB	tp
a- and < school > that's when I really began to , um , gain my confiden	really	R	PREVB	tp
made it to some of the ones I really wanna get to . Like , I haven't	really	R	PREVB	tp
um , it was just good to to- to really experience a unique sound from	really	R	PREVB	tp
a- and original edge to me . I really like you know , Chuck Brown . He	really	R	PREVB	tp
f the newer bands just weren't really doing it for me . And then um ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
s when I first , um , < ts > first really , you know , got into poetry . An	really	R	PREVB	tp
know . And so , um , < ts > I just really wasn't into it and now- you kn	really	R	PREVB	tp
, the campus life , um , it just really wasn't as , you know , as good a	really	R	PREVB	tp
in the later years . Like w- we really developed , you know , over the	really	R	PREVB	tp
I had a good time . Yes sir . I really did . I had a good time . Yeah .	really	R	PREVB	tp
the pu- public schools weren't really teaching enough in my parents '	really	R	PREVB	tp
ll of these things . And < ts > I really think that that's- those negat	really	R	PREVB	tp
we getting displaced ! And I'm really , I'm joking , but literally , ju	really	R	PREVB	tp
erences . It's not like I- I- I really should just take people for wh	really	R	PREVB	tp
l that about white people ? Oh . Really ? I'm like yeah . Fuck that . I d	really	R	POSTVB	tp
> Road , the house . So , I don't really remember th- I mean I remember	really	R	PREVB	tp
- This is like a church he was really , um , a part of , and he always	really	R	POSTVB	tp
t the whole story , is when she really turned on her son , because she	really	R	PREVB	tp
push boundaries , so . She never really had to worry about it . Um , yea	really	R	PREVB	tp
so far apart . Cause I grew up really fast being with them . You know	really	R	POSTVB	tp
ology that kids my age weren't really paying attention to . You know ,	really	R	PREVB	tp
t was like that . I mean , I was really grateful to have parents that	really	R	PREJJ	tp
your childhood ? I feel like I really s- I really did have a childho	really	R	PREVB	tp
hing . Like I ( laughing ) wasn't really interested in that . Mm-hm . Mm ,	really	R	PREJJ	tp
yeah . At that time it wasn't really Northwest . Northwest wasn't re	really	R	PREJJ	tp
u fail the class . And I didn't really think , oh I won't pass it , but	really	R	PREVB	tp

stuff like that , so . Um , I did really good my eleventh grade year , u	really	R	PREJJ	tp
frequent these places , I don't really know as much as I did then . Bu	really	R	PREVB	tp

ed to go to Syracuse or NYU , I really wanted to go to NYU , that w- I	really	R	PREVB	tp
ol , but I really liked < school > . So , that's how	really	R	PREVB	tp
at I would've gotten in . And I really liked < school > . Fordham was co	really	R	PREVB	tp
the country to kn- know that I really liked New York , I felt like th	really	R	PREVB	tp
her one of my friends , I'm not really friends with her anymore but u	really	R	POSTVB	tp
t child and adult . So , I don't really enjoy activities that make me	really	R	PREVB	tp
little foreign to me I didn't really- yeah , it took a while for me	really	R	PREVB	tp
ou get a sense of pride . Like , really ? That happened here ? You know ?	really	R	POSTVB	tp
those relationships were just really close so a lot of my social we	really	R	PREJJ	tp
ke from middle school I didn't really keep in touch with past middle	really	R	PREVB	tp

time , when I was growing up , I really didn't like to see people do i	really	R	PREVB	tp
d . It did show me again that I really don't wanna practice , so it el	really	R	PREVB	tp
whatever they say to me can't really shake me in my core . Like your	really	R	PREVB	tp
er when this place when nobody really wanted to be here . And , so whe	really	R	PREVB	tp

thing in the world but I don't really see the value in it just becau	really	R	PREVB	tp
Um , and like , I find that they really do appreciate the stuff I do f	really	R	PREVB	tp
Georgetown had given me which really sucked . Um , and I've actu- the	really	R	PREVB	tp
ted of me . Um , and I just feel really comfortable there . Mm . Yeah . E	really	R	PREJJ	tp

we lived in . Um , my dad was a really um , family oriented kind of gu	really	R	NPAM	tp
e sky idea of what my life was really gonna be like , and she's telli	really	R	PREVB	tp

thirty percent of our kids are respectful the rest of ' em are just disre	respectful	A	A	tn

pers back then . And it was not safe . It was shootings all the time	safe	A	A	tn
e tree before he can , then you safe . But if he catches you off bas	safe	A	A	tn
there so it was a little more safe , but like a block away was lik	safe	A	A	tn
y . My mom made sure that I was safe , so I think that wasn't ghetto	safe	A	A	tn
and you know they say it's not safe to stay in a um- uh- trailer w	safe	A	A	tn
I- I think he kind of kept me safe . But once I got old enough to	safe	A	A	tn
put him in a um- a um- a b- a safe- a locked safe so- so the othe	safe	A	A	tn
ry school . But it still wasn't safe . Was just like , more older peo	safe	A	A	tn
ur little area felt little too safe , and so we wanted to like find	safe	A	A	tn
building . The building wasn't safe . Yeah . Yeah . This is what she	safe	A	A	tn
d a space that they would feel safe in . Um , so you made that choic	safe	A	A	tn
wanna let y'all know , like , be safe around , um , the good touch bad	safe	A	A	tn
hallway too . That was another safe place . Play out in the hallway	safe	A	A	tn

k when I felt like that wasn't safe some nights I would go in aban	safe	A	A	tn
in this area I feel a lot more safe , like I know a lot of people i	safe	A	A	tn
ause like , that's where I feel safe at . Thirty seven . N- yeah , tha	safe	A	A	tn

e had a - we always had , uh , a safe haven when we were younger , al	safe	A	A	tn
ind living here . So there- I'm safe . I'm comfortable here . I'm not	safe	A	A	tn
I don't think I would feel as safe in a place like that where I'm	safe	A	A	tn
e out . But if it didn't he was safe , as long as he got away from t	safe	A	A	tn
st looking like , wow , you feel safe here ? And that's how I felt wh	safe	A	A	tn
an calm down , they're gonna be safe . So I just have to second thin	safe	A	A	tn

on't know if I perceived it as safe because I was so young , um , bu	safe	A	A	tn
grew up . So I don't feel that safe . But I- I wouldn't raise them	safe	A	A	tn
remember , um , is that it was a safe environment when I was younger	safe	A	A	tn
ing that . So , all I said , that safe situation , that between the gi	safe	A	A	tn
- when- when the parks weren't safe , that was a- that was my mothe	safe	A	A	tn
he U of R , but it might not be safe and so they're taking up real	safe	A	A	tn

s , what happened ? I was in the seventh grade . I'll never forget . And	seventh	A	A	tn
went to that high school from seventh to twelfth grade , and I believ	seventh	A	A	tn
e , and- and the third , and the seventh grade , the- my English class .	seventh	A	A	tn
ifth grade and sixth grade and seventh grade . Sh- she would not let u	seventh	A	A	tn
y'all come from ? That was like seventh grade . Seventh grade you start	seventh	A	A	tn
dergarten . But when we started seventh grade , not only did I have tho	seventh	A	A	tn
ddle school , as I was going to seventh grade , so what actually happen	seventh	A	A	tn
ght back to < school > . That was seventh grade . So at that point when I	seventh	A	A	tn
in New York . And I remember in seventh grade I like went to visit the	seventh	A	A	tn

skipped up a grade in math . So seventh grade year , I was actually in	seventh	A	A	tn
to the middle school . Start at seventh grade , went through to eighth	seventh	A	A	tn
ng . I- I- I think he about the seventh , eighth , Prea- Seven or eighth	seventh	A	A	tn
bout doing a middle school for seventh and eighth . So I started a int	seventh	A	A	tn
I got skipped in < school > from seventh to the ninth . Mm-hm . And then ,	seventh	A	A	tn
n information that I gained in seventh grade , apparently some of my o	seventh	A	A	tn
stal's . So I- I- this is like , seventh or eighth ? Probably eighth gra	seventh	A	A	tn
ted from Number < school > after seventh grade , I went on to < school > .	seventh	A	A	tn
ng . Wait when my son is in the seventh grade and he doing math I- I k	seventh	A	A	tn

girl got treated- and this was sixth grade- My teacher , Miss < name >	sixth	A	A	tn

t going there because she's in sixth grade . Like , I went to < school	sixth	A	A	tn
fifth grade , and the next year sixth grade . But I think after fifth	sixth	A	A	tn
s that should be in the fifth , sixth grade , but we put them in the	sixth	A	A	tn
d to to take- do the fifth and sixth grade over at Lovejoy . Oh I lo	sixth	A	A	tn

think that was fifth grade , no sixth grade . I met this guy , he was	sixth	A	A	tn
t I can think of . Oh except in sixth grade , this boy brought in thi	sixth	A	A	tn
. But then , um , like maybe the sixth period , I actually was a stude	sixth	A	A	tn
< name > . So Miss < name > was my sixth grade teacher , and she- she's	sixth	A	A	tn
nineteen seventy-nine . August sixth , nineteen seventy-nine , a matt	sixth	A	A	tn

m . Slow jam . Play another slow jam . And it- and that was the	slow	A	A	tn
ame like fast paced and not as slow as theirs was . And so , just be	slow	A	A	tn
slow pace for the older crowd cause	slow	A	A	tn
ike Chuck Brown'd be like more slow pace . Or you know you had more	slow	A	A	tn
in our day we used to call it slow dragging . Yeah . So it's not th	slow	A	A	tn

of- kind of tough . < sigh > Just slowly over time , pretty much . Yeah .	slowly	R	POSTVB	tp
we gonna start down here , and slowly move up through Mississippi , t	slowly	R	PREVB	tp
it . And that's what started to slowly but surely change my mindset u	slowly	R	PREVB	tp
suspicions and , you know , but slowly what would happen was as peopl	slowly	R	PREVB	tp
just keep moving that way . But slowly make our way up as well . Like	slowly	R	PREVB	tp

then California . And then just slowly move up . And then come back ar	slowly	R	PREVB	tp

ll these debates that I see on social media- I guess I should say ?	social	A	A	tn
and there was this kind of c- social cast system in < school > High S	social	A	A	tn
they're on social media . I saw- I saw actually a	social	A	A	tn
where . Um , especially like the social stuff , like the clubs , they al	social	A	A	tn
know , I sort of wanted to be a social worker , something like that . O	social	A	A	tn
it like he do like- Today , in social studies , we got to play a game	social	A	A	tn
black students , because say a social status uh , requires this . Th-	social	A	A	tn
um- the social s- the social code is becoming now , where yo	social	A	A	tn
pting the Negro as people , the social code ha- wa- h- has required t	social	A	A	tn

can't tell so much in terms of social hem- is it that I'm noticing i	social	A	A	tn
hing that I've noticed . From a social perspective , < ts > and , maybe I	social	A	A	tn
' ll have on , on your kids , the social growth they'll have is exponen	social	A	A	tn
o . Um . I think , from a , from a social perspective , I've noticed ther	social	A	A	tn
e anybody does , but it has its social impact as well . Whereas , I thi	social	A	A	tn
cademic , but I also care about social jus- justice issues . And I fee	social	A	A	tn
Yeah , I was still in it . Oh my social group varies from- < laugh > < la	social	A	A	tn
make a larger impact on , like , social justice issues . And I felt lik	social	A	A	tn
services . You know we had good social services and stuff for people	social	A	A	tn
ce , truly appreciate that . The social experience not so much . And , u	social	A	A	tn
are not there . So , that whole social community thing is becoming le	social	A	A	tn
lot of- there's not that same social thing going on . Yeah . There wa	social	A	A	tn
eans there's not gonna be that social gathering , that's not gonna ha	social	A	A	tn
. Well , I mean there's certain social things that you're- that you c	social	A	A	tn
ing back and forth down to uh , social security my SSI , Supplemental	social	A	A	tn
happen , and then everybody on social media , everybody is like , this	social	A	A	tn
as the purpose it served like , social , black exercise . < ts > Because	social	A	A	tn
just supposed to be something social and exercise . Not scar me and	social	A	A	tn
st really close so a lot of my social weekend time throughout high s	social	A	A	tn
elong to the club , you see . My social club is but the main one I gue	social	A	A	tn
to as- as a group now , is the social club that I belong to . It's ca	social	A	A	tn
were doing community work and social work and caring about the peop	social	A	A	tn
everywhere . So ther- that was social time . And I think that's proba	social	A	A	tn
we had six centers , and we had social workers working in each of the	social	A	A	tn
hat . We had so much time to be social . I did not . I sang , uh , in- in	social	A	A	tn
all . It's just perpetuating a social s- uh- social construct . It's	social	A	A	tn
with school life and- and now social life and um I live in a predom	social	A	A	tn
knew- I d- I didn't grow up on social services . My grandmother alway	social	A	A	tn
nderstood . Um , and so I was on social services probably for like a y	social	A	A	tn
know , mostly held by you know , social workers and college- you know ,	social	A	A	tn
. My mother , she's she's uh , a social worker . In d- in um , the Lower	social	A	A	tn
stuff , most of it is social . And we did social , business ,	social	A	A	tn
hought I should have went into social work . But I don't feel like I	social	A	A	tn
had to go into social work to be in social work . Yea	social	A	A	tn
life like . Well , something on social media about DC , it was like , D	social	A	A	tn
tuff like that . But we do have social media and stuff I can keep con	social	A	A	tn
It's just a lot . And then with social media you can't trust anybody .	social	A	A	tn
. Uh after lunch is another um social hour are um for those who it m	social	A	A	tn
it changed that much . Well , my social life is missing a lot , unfortu	social	A	A	tn
ool . Made a big difference . My social life was cut down completely .	social	A	A	tn
Uh , again this is sort of a s- social hour , we're running around and	social	A	A	tn
nd a year . But when I became a social worker , like , that was still t	social	A	A	tn
uld be an English teacher or a social worker , and I woulda made twen	social	A	A	tn
ight . Then I w- then I went to social work . Yeah . Uh-huh . Right . And	social	A	A	tn
And uh , I got my uh , degree in social work . And I supervised . ooh , w	social	A	A	tn
I think we have a lot of , um , social welfare programs . I think we d	social	A	A	tn
k- I mean you think about , um , social media and who all the trolls a	social	A	A	tn
ake an English class , and a- a social work class . And I always made	social	A	A	tn
pposed to be a lawyer . She's a social worker . ( laughing ) He's like ,	social	A	A	tn

l like I should have went with social work . Mm-hm . Yeah , my own ment	social	A	A	tn
bly about a hundred times more social . Because , again , uh , I had spe	social	A	A	tn
about family , than I would say social experiences . Um , when I was in	social	A	A	tn

Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm . It's- It's totally different than hip hop . Like ,	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
pective probably would've been totally different , you know , you would	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
w , that you were wro- that was totally wrong as opposed to what you k	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
outside do , but the inside is totally different . They remodeled it ,	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
ome diversity uh , but now it's totally Caucasian . Hm . Period . Is it w	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
uliani came into office , was a totally different ball game . Used to s	totally	R	NPAM	tp
it's gonna get way ( laughing ) totally different than what it is now .	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
hich obviously they lived in a totally different time frame , so if yo	totally	R	NPAM	tp
n fourteen and eighteen , I'm a totally different person . I say me get	totally	R	NPAM	tp
Waldorf and Bryans Road , it's totally different . It's totally differ	totally	R	PREJJ	tp

omebody treated me . But it was totally up to me to determine how I tr	totally	R	POSTVB	tp
would happen that he would be- totally be calm . My mother was good at	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
n getting me a car . Cause it's totally different , like in New York yo	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
ol > all left . And they got two totally new groups . That next year . So	totally	R	NPAM	tp
d's , um , your CVS's . It's just totally different , like everybody's al	totally	R	PREJJ	tp

u know . They- they come from a totally different element , and uh , I d	totally	R	NPAM	tp
sts . But the way they do it is totally different from the actual vers	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
hen I went to < school > , it was totally different . It was just < school	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
the answers on this side were totally different than the answers on	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
, you- you could not ignore it totally . It depends to what level do I	totally	R	POSTVB	tp
tia , up on the hill , and I had totally forgotten about that until som	totally	R	PREVB	tp
ad happened was- I know it was totally different . Um , it was a Friday	totally	R	PREJJ	tp

as- < clears throat > Yeah , I've totally lost- Mm-hm . Right . Mm-hm . < la	totally	R	PREVB	tp
And then high school was like totally different . But even before lik	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
ed . I don't know whether I can totally agree with that because I feel	totally	R	PREVB	tp
, but besides the flood it was totally different . It was a totally di	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
house that was once here , was totally underwater . Uh , it didn't leav	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
and then I got there and I was totally overwhelmed like , getting lost	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
t everybody did it . It had- It totally- It really did . It really did .	totally	R	PREVB	tp
, in band but band friends are totally different from , you know , frie	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
when we went . It was something totally different because I'm not be-	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
victims at the Pentagon . And I totally disengaged from my job . It was	totally	R	PREVB	tp
epared even though I had had a totally different kind of exper- feel	totally	R	NPAM	tp
people so even though I didn't totally understand like , you know , why	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
just kind of a like , I didn't totally buy in , um , initially . Um , but	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
e street , and you're like in a totally different neighborhood . You're	totally	R	NPAM	tp
er- during that process , I was totally disengaged from < work > . And at	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
ause their whole lifestyle was totally different from mine . And it wa	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
ah , the neighborhood just look totally different . No , it- it- it's no	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
went to the < school > , um , was totally just like- I didn't- o- o- out	totally	R	POSTVB	tp
ime after that . Um . Oh , it was totally different then . Yeah , it was t	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
otally totally different . Like , I mean . I did	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
s- I- The perception of it has totally changed . I'm sure , I'm- Actual	totally	R	PREVB	tp
they were formulated was just totally different , they was like one o	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
as totally different . Like , it was kind o	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
But that sound right there was totally different , the pace you know w	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
about < school > was that it was totally mixed , totally mixed . It was l	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
hwest and their sound was just totally different . Buggy and Sauce had	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
in that neighborhood , which is totally different than the way my- my	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
et a job at The Beacon , it was totally different then , and that was a	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
. Then I see a fly- I was like totally against the community service	totally	R	POSTVB	tp
re . And I know their words are totally different than ours um , growin	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
r and my aunt . Mm-hm , which is totally different now . But , yeah . It w	totally	R	PREJJ	tp
Arlington and Alexandria . It's totally different . I don't- I don't- I	totally	R	PREJJ	tp

great at it . Make it worth it , totally worth it . I mean , come on , we	totally	R	POSTVB	tp

all the time . They say she was tough , boy . Yeah , she was- she was a	tough	A	A	tn
it , but it's kind of- kind of tough . < sigh > Just slowly over time ,	tough	A	A	tn
ut , that's what . Yeah , she was tough . But , so , other than that , we	tough	A	A	tn
on't give up cause it may seem tough now , you know , it may be like ,	tough	A	A	tn
guess certain classes just get tough and tougher for me . You know ,	tough	A	A	tn

d all of the games were pretty tough . I played tackle . I played cen	tough	A	A	tn
o see The Wild Bunch . It was a tough thing . It's a tough thing . Wel	tough	A	A	tn

s , cause we always said he was tough < laugh > And then we had um- uh	tough	A	A	tn
math- yeah math , ugh- uh , it's tough . It was like , uh , if I have to	tough	A	A	tn
rst championship run . That was tough . They had uh , it was , uh Damia	tough	A	A	tn

erstand , you know , he was very tough , very , uh , strict in what he d	tough	A	A	tn
o's neck , to bite through that tough ass hide and eat that shit raw	tough	A	A	tn
girl , so when she left , it was tough . So I would go down and see he	tough	A	A	tn
name now . But anyway , she was tough . She loved < name > but she did	tough	A	A	tn
And , you know , it- it's- it's tough . It's tough . Exactly . And- n-	tough	A	A	tn
, um , < school > - it was more t- tough socially more than anything . U	tough	A	A	tn
osed to get , well , she's got a tough balancing act to do that , and	tough	A	A	tn
was- it was- it was- it was a tough transition at first . I mean , I	tough	A	A	tn
ean it was cool , I mean it was tough because of how big our family	tough	A	A	tn
s what it is . Yeah . Yeah it is tough growing up without no- you kno	tough	A	A	tn

to it . I'm like , it's gonna be tough , but that's what I wanna do . I	tough	A	A	tn
So , like that was really , uh , tough trying to get like fresh c- pr	tough	A	A	tn

allas . Yeah . It's definitely a tough season . But , I don't really ge	tough	A	A	tn
eeping it- um , < ts > keeping it traditional here . And the same Chester the	traditional	A	A	tn

d Rare Essence and some of the traditional kind of go go music cause it w	traditional	A	A	tn
at that I like is usually more traditional and- and more characteristic o	traditional	A	A	tn
after that , and if it's not a traditional route , don't be afraid of that	traditional	A	A	tn
and Christmas out of a kind of traditional uh procedure . Mm-hm . Mm-hm . Oh	traditional	A	A	tn
m . There was probably like the traditional three m- what they called shot	traditional	A	A	tn
' t have to think of going that traditional path . Think about what you wan	traditional	A	A	tn
time I'd had homework and like traditional lecture and textbook type of l	traditional	A	A	tn
ion cause that was a much more traditional , uh , school setting . Still rea	traditional	A	A	tn

brother had friends like , real true friends from the community . An	true	A	A	tn
ust need to understand we , the true Lower East Siders , are the peo	true	A	A	tn
ll come , but that's not always true . Right . Well yeah . You made me	true	A	A	tn
old person . < ts > But- Mm , it's true . I don't know . Uh , I don't kno	true	A	A	tn
whole thing which is you , the true you , and break you down . So it	true	A	A	tn
way . That ain't truly you . The true you is a baby that knows how t	true	A	A	tn
ou cursing somebody . Those are true curses . Like spells are made o	true	A	A	tn
good reputation at all . It was true , cause l- lot- a lot of the ki	true	A	A	tn
round in this system . When the true you come out , it's like that f	true	A	A	tn
y . But what she was saying was true because I found out later on t	true	A	A	tn
its lovely promise won't come true ( singing ) . I didn't get throug	true	A	A	tn
up all the time , like it ain't true peace here , because the system	true	A	A	tn
nd out what she was saying was true , you know . See she was kind of	true	A	A	tn
thing , I mean maybe that's not true maybe I'm exaggerating , I feel	true	A	A	tn
this sounds terrible but it's true . Getting lost like trying to f	true	A	A	tn
( laughing ) But um- that's not true . They bought me clothes but I	true	A	A	tn
h straight . And that's- that's true for me . I'm- I was a l- a kid	true	A	A	tn
pay less than that . That is so true . < name > was talking about that	true	A	A	tn
I think we just need that one true star player . Which is gonna be	true	A	A	tn
from here . And he's actually a true Wizards fan . Wouldn't you beli	true	A	A	tn
the skill sets- and then that true lack of- what I would say the	true	A	A	tn
t my children , know , see , like true- well , construction not counti	true	A	A	tn
at and that wouldn't just hold true for the Lower East Side . That	true	A	A	tn
osed to have been taken from a true story , and you wonder how much	true	A	A	tn
your mouth , but you have to be true to who you are because people	true	A	A	tn
saying , or ? Yeah like it- it's true like , you know what I'm saying	true	A	A	tn
have to say about that . That's true . That's right . It doesn't worr	true	A	A	tn
I think it was about you know , true- true to life as it could ever	true	A	A	tn
house , be like , is this really true ? Cause I remember when we used	true	A	A	tn
bamas . I was like , that's not true . Um , DC started calling people	true	A	A	tn
n , I have found this out to be true , will take more of advantage o	true	A	A	tn
. You know . We hope that it be true . Yeah . Um , well with the neigh	true	A	A	tn
o we know that you know we are true friends cause it alway the s-	true	A	A	tn
ell yeah , man . Nah , that's not true . Have you ever seen Menace to	true	A	A	tn
equal , and I found out that's true because uh , some people in my	true	A	A	tn
interview m- session , but it's true . Um , I remember when they firs	true	A	A	tn
ng . But my children know true seasons . I love Rochester's ri	true	A	A	tn
should hold true for- for any neighborhood . You	true	A	A	tn
en . Which I don't think that's true either , but . They just are a l	true	A	A	tn
y and f- f- It was fun . That's true . That is true . I don't remembe	true	A	A	tn
shitty pay . And I guess that's true . It sucks though . I feel like ,	true	A	A	tn
that's something that could be true . You know it shows that a rela	true	A	A	tn
me , you know , and could it be true . Cause really nowadays you can	true	A	A	tn
Friday . I was like , that is so true . Yeah , minimum wage ain't even	true	A	A	tn
incredible . But it really was true though . And if you could see t	true	A	A	tn
that's said often but is very true is that uh , closed mouth don't	true	A	A	tn
e- the- the lights came on was true . Our parents didn't know where	true	A	A	tn
g chess . So , if you ain't- the true you ain't really the one that '	true	A	A	tn
u know , Browncroft , it's not a true- like there's street signs on	true	A	A	tn
s and not the ones who are not true urban communities . Like if you	true	A	A	tn
where I reside right now . I am true native . Yes . I went to < school	true	A	A	tn
to like have certain things be true despite what people would thin	true	A	A	tn
, tearing that- honestly , it's true , cause mowing it down- I'd lik	true	A	A	tn
ell , I mean , you know , that is true that , you know , everybody got	true	A	A	tn
e houses . I mean , it's kind of true . Like it's definitely like , if	true	A	A	tn
t they don't even know if it's true or not but they going with it ,	true	A	A	tn
and still , I felt like , well , true enough . You don't have to deal	true	A	A	tn
rican families , I think that's true . I think that there wer- I'm t	true	A	A	tn
ory . So I don't know if that's true , but that is what I'm putting	true	A	A	tn
time- I think it's definitely true today . I think that- but I thi	true	A	A	tn
ll . But unfortunately , that is true . Oh yeah . Cause if you don't h	true	A	A	tn
ogram . This was- just is- very true . Literally , I was like probabl	true	A	A	tn
e and stuff ? Do you think it's true ? I don't know . I don't put any	true	A	A	tn
d shout outs . That's it . Pure , true go go , percussion and shout ou	true	A	A	tn
world , because those words are true . There's no such thing as a li	true	A	A	tn
to Rock Creek Park- this is a true story- I rode to Rock Creek Pa	true	A	A	tn
now that- I don't know if it's true or not- That it's hard for the	true	A	A	tn

ther . I'm like , where'd I went wrong at ? Now I'm questioning myself	wrong	A	A	tn
I say what I did , don't get me wrong , I said , but what I did , I set	wrong	A	A	tn
hink if that incident went the wrong way , of course I would- of cou	wrong	A	A	tn
hose little times when they're wrong , and they figure that out . The	wrong	A	A	tn
right cause I don't like being wrong . I don't like feeling like I'v	wrong	A	A	tn
rents done , you know , right or wrong , led me to this point of where	wrong	A	A	tn
e done did something wrong , so . I always try to be right	wrong	A	A	tn
ogizing and say that they were wrong for what they done . And other	wrong	A	A	tn
one sit up there and prove you wrong . There's a better way . There's	wrong	A	A	tn

t's no right or wrong answers . You ha- may have a pe	wrong	A	A	tn
imply tell you what's right or wrong . But we ch- We choose the dire	wrong	A	A	tn
f the stuff that he's doing is wrong and it's gonna affect people l	wrong	A	A	tn
e wants you to tell him what's wrong and how you feel like you coul	wrong	A	A	tn
ell us what's right and what's wrong . They already been through the	wrong	A	A	tn

want people to acknowledge the wrong and let's see if we can , um , d	wrong	A	A	tn
to kill her , there's something wrong . I don't want them- I don't wa	wrong	A	A	tn
and she gonna tell you that's wrong . And um , like um , Arithmetic ,	wrong	A	A	tn
onna always tell you something wrong now . That's the best you can d	wrong	A	A	tn
onna always tell you something wrong with it . Like you write your h	wrong	A	A	tn

like , I'm- I'm gonna prove you wrong . I- I- I- I'm gonna definitely	wrong	A	A	tn
prove you wrong . So if that means consciously	wrong	A	A	tn
tely know I didn't do anything wrong , then I'm gonna talk . But then	wrong	A	A	tn
omes , not about being right or wrong . It becomes , I need to make su	wrong	A	A	tn
